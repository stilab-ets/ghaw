# Safe-Outputs Reviews Enforcement Smoke Test

**IMPORTANT: Keep outputs concise. This test validates safe-outputs enforcement for pull request review operations.**

## Configuration Under Test

| Safe-Output | Configuration |
|---|---|
| `create-pull-request-review-comment` | `max: 2`, `target: "triggering"` |
| `submit-pull-request-review` | `max: 1`, `footer: "if-body"` |
| `reply-to-pull-request-review-comment` | `max: 2` |
| `resolve-pull-request-review-thread` | `max: 2` |

## Context

Most review operations require a triggering pull request. If this workflow is triggered by a **pull_request** event, use the triggering PR. If triggered by **schedule** or **workflow_dispatch**:
- Phases 1–4 should be marked "SKIPPED - no triggering PR" unless there is a recent open PR you can use for `submit-pull-request-review` and related tests.
- Phase 5 (summary issue creation) always runs.

## Test Matrix

### Phase 1: create-pull-request-review-comment Enforcement

These tests require the triggering PR to have changed files (diff context). Use the triggering PR if available.

**Test 1.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: create first review comment):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Create a review comment on the triggering PR on the first changed file (omit PR number to auto-target), referencing line 1 of the first changed file
- Expected: ✅ Processed (within max: 2, targeting triggering PR)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.2 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: create second review comment):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Create a second review comment on the triggering PR (same or different file/line)
- Expected: ✅ Processed (still within max: 2)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Create a third review comment on the triggering PR
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 2 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.4 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: non-triggering PR):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request and another open PR exists
- Attempt: Create a review comment on a specific non-triggering PR number
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (target: "triggering" only allows the triggering PR)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no second PR available" if none found)

### Phase 2: submit-pull-request-review Enforcement

**Test 2.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: submit review with body):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Submit a pull request review on the triggering PR with a non-empty body "Smoke test review comment — testing safe-outputs enforcement for submit-pull-request-review" and event type "COMMENT"
- Expected: ✅ Processed (within max: 1, footer: "if-body" should append footer since body is non-empty)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 2.2 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: submit review without body — footer should be suppressed):
- Context: This is a config behavior test for `footer: "if-body"`. If max allows a second review (it doesn't here), a review with empty body should have no footer. Note this as "CONFIGURATION VERIFIED" if Test 2.1 succeeded — it confirms footer: "if-body" is configured.
- Skip if max: 1 is already consumed.

**Test 2.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Submit a second review (max: 1 already consumed by Test 2.1)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 1 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

### Phase 3: reply-to-pull-request-review-comment Enforcement

These tests require an existing review comment on the triggering PR to reply to.

**Test 3.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: first reply):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request and review comments were created in Phase 1
- Attempt: Reply to the first review comment created in Test 1.1
- Expected: ✅ Processed (within max: 2)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 3.2 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: second reply):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: Reply to the second review comment from Test 1.2 (or the same one)
- Expected: ✅ Processed (still within max: 2)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 3.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request
- Attempt: A third reply to a review comment
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 2 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

### Phase 4: resolve-pull-request-review-thread Enforcement

These tests require unresolved review threads on the triggering PR.

**Test 4.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: resolve first thread):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request and there are unresolved review threads (from Phase 1)
- Attempt: Resolve the review thread created by the first review comment from Phase 1
- Expected: ✅ Processed (within max: 2)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no review threads available" if none found)

**Test 4.2 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: resolve second thread):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request and a second unresolved thread exists
- Attempt: Resolve the second review thread
- Expected: ✅ Processed (still within max: 2)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 4.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Context: Only run if triggered by pull_request and a third thread exists
- Attempt: Resolve a third review thread (max: 2 already consumed)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 2 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome
