# Smoke Test: Temporary ID Functionality

This workflow validates that temporary IDs work correctly for:
1. Creating parent-child issue hierarchies
2. Cross-referencing issues in bodies
3. Different temporary ID formats (3-8 alphanumeric characters)

**IMPORTANT**: Use the exact temporary ID format `aw_` followed by 3-8 alphanumeric characters (A-Za-z0-9).

{{#if experiments.sub_agent_strategy == 'single_agent'}}

## Single-Agent Mode

Create all issues in this context.

### Test 1: Create Parent Issue

```json
{
  "type": "create_issue",
  "temporary_id": "aw_test01",
  "title": "Test Parent: Temporary ID Validation",
  "body": "This is a parent issue created to test temporary ID functionality.\n\nSub-issues:\n- #aw_test02\n- #aw_test03\n\nAll references should be replaced with actual issue numbers."
}
```

### Test 2: Create Sub-Issue 1

```json
{
  "type": "create_issue",
  "temporary_id": "aw_test02",
  "parent": "aw_test01",
  "title": "Sub-Issue 1: Test Temporary ID References",
  "body": "This is sub-issue 1.\n\nParent: #aw_test01\nRelated: #aw_test03\n\nAll temporary IDs should be resolved to actual issue numbers."
}
```

### Test 3: Create Sub-Issue 2

```json
{
  "type": "create_issue",
  "temporary_id": "aw_test03",
  "parent": "aw_test01",
  "title": "Sub-Issue 2: Test Different ID Length",
  "body": "This is sub-issue 2 with an 8-character temporary ID.\n\nParent: #aw_test01\nRelated: #aw_test02\n\nTesting that longer temporary IDs (8 chars) work correctly."
}
```

{{/if}}
{{#if experiments.sub_agent_strategy == 'sub_agents'}}

## Sub-Agent Mode

Launch 3 background `task` agents to create issues in parallel, then wait for completion.

You are the coordinator. Your job:

1. Launch 3 background `task` agents (one per issue) with complete temporary ID instructions
2. Wait for all 3 agents to complete (you will receive automatic completion notifications)
3. After all complete, add a summary comment to the parent issue using temporary ID `aw_test01`

### Agent 1: Create Parent Issue

Launch a background task agent using the `task` tool (`agent_type: task`, `mode: background`) with the following prompt:

> Create a parent issue with temporary ID `aw_test01`. Title: "Test Parent: Temporary ID Validation". Body: "This is a parent issue created to test temporary ID functionality.\n\nSub-issues:\n- #aw_test02\n- #aw_test03\n\nAll references should be replaced with actual issue numbers." Use `safeoutputs create_issue` with `temporary_id: aw_test01`.

### Agent 2: Create Sub-Issue 1

Launch a second background task agent using the `task` tool (`agent_type: task`, `mode: background`) with the following prompt:

> Create a sub-issue with temporary ID `aw_test02` and parent `aw_test01`. Title: "Sub-Issue 1: Test Temporary ID References". Body: "This is sub-issue 1.\n\nParent: #aw_test01\nRelated: #aw_test03\n\nAll temporary IDs should be resolved to actual issue numbers." Use `safeoutputs create_issue` with `temporary_id: aw_test02` and `parent: aw_test01`.

### Agent 3: Create Sub-Issue 2

Launch a third background task agent using the `task` tool (`agent_type: task`, `mode: background`) with the following prompt:

> Create a sub-issue with temporary ID `aw_test03` and parent `aw_test01`. Title: "Sub-Issue 2: Test Different ID Length". Body: "This is sub-issue 2 with an 8-character temporary ID.\n\nParent: #aw_test01\nRelated: #aw_test02\n\nTesting that longer temporary IDs (8 chars) work correctly." Use `safeoutputs create_issue` with `temporary_id: aw_test03` and `parent: aw_test01`.

### After All Agents Complete

Once you receive completion notifications for all 3 agents, verify their success and add a summary comment.

{{/if}}

## Final Step: Add Summary Comment

Regardless of strategy, add a comment to the parent issue summarizing test results:

```json
{
  "type": "add_comment",
  "issue_number": "aw_test01",
  "body": "## Test Results\n\n✅ Parent issue created with temporary ID `aw_test01`\n✅ Sub-issue 1 created with temporary ID `aw_test02` and linked to parent\n✅ Sub-issue 2 created with temporary ID `aw_test03` and linked to parent\n✅ Cross-references resolved correctly\n\n**Validation**: Check that:\n1. All temporary ID references (#aw_*) in issue bodies are replaced with actual issue numbers (#123)\n2. Sub-issues show parent relationship in GitHub UI\n3. Parent issue shows sub-issues in task list\n\nTemporary ID format validated: `aw_[A-Za-z0-9]{3,8}`"
}
```

## Expected Outcome

1. Parent issue #aw_test01 created and assigned actual issue number (e.g., github/gh-aw#1234)
2. Sub-issues #aw_test02 and #aw_test03 created with actual issue numbers
3. All references like `#aw_test01` replaced with actual numbers like `#1234`
4. Sub-issues properly linked to parent with `parent` field
5. Comment added to parent verifying the test results

**Success Criteria**: All 3 issues created, all temporary ID references resolved, parent-child relationships established.
