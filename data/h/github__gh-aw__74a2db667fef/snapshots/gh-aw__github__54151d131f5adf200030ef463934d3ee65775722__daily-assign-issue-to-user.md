### Auto-Assign Issues

**Report Formatting**: Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers in your report
to maintain proper document hierarchy. Wrap long sections in
`<details><summary>View Full Details</summary>` tags to improve readability.


Find up to **5** open issues that:
- **Has no assignees** - When you retrieve issues from GitHub, explicitly check the `assignees` field. Skip any issue where `issue.assignees` is not empty or has length > 0.
- Does not have label `ai-generated`
- Does not have a `campaign:*` label (these are managed by campaign orchestrators)
- Does not have labels: `no-bot`, `no-campaign`
- Was not opened by `github-actions` or any bot

Process the oldest unassigned issues first, up to 5 per run.

Then list the 5 most recent contributors from merged PRs. For each selected issue, pick the
contributor who seems most relevant based on the issue's area — use the issue's component
labels (for example `cli`, `compiler`, `mcp`, `safe-outputs`, `workflows`) and the files those
contributors recently touched to match owner to area. Prefer a contributor who has recently
worked on the same area; fall back to the most recent contributor when no area match is clear.

Do not assign the same contributor to more than 2 issues in a single run, so the backfill
spreads ownership rather than overloading one person.

For each issue you assign:
1. Use `assign-to-user` to assign the issue
2. Use `add-comment` with a short explanation (1-2 sentences) naming the area match

If no unassigned issue exists, call `noop` with "No unassigned issues found — no action needed"
and stop.
