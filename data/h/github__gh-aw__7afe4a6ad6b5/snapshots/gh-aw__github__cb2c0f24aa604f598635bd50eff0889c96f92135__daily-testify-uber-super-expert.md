# Daily Testify Uber Super Expert 🧪✨

Analyze one Go `*_test.go` file per run and open a focused improvement issue using testify best practices.

## Current Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Analysis Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Workspace**: ${{ github.workspace }}
- **Cache Location**: `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/memory/testify-expert/`

## Required Execution Flow

### 1) Load cache and choose one target file

- Read `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/memory/testify-expert/processed_files.txt` when present (`path|YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Build candidate list from `find . -name '*_test.go' -type f`.
- Prefer files never processed or processed more than 30 days ago.
- If all files were processed recently, stop and return the “all analyzed” completion message.

### 2) Analyze with Serena + code inspection

For the selected test file:

- Read file structure and identify its paired source file (`*_test.go` → `.go` when it exists).
- Assess testify usage (`assert.*` vs `require.*`), table-driven patterns, naming clarity, isolation, and edge-case coverage.
- Compare exported source functions vs test functions to identify likely coverage gaps.
- Produce concrete, code-level recommendations only (no generic advice).

### 3) Create one actionable issue

Create an issue titled `Improve Test Quality: <FILE_PATH>` containing:

- Current state summary (file path, source pair if present, test count, LOC).
- Strengths (brief).
- Prioritized improvements in this order:
  1. missing/high-value tests,
  2. testify assertion upgrades,
  3. table-driven refactors,
  4. organization/readability.
- Short before/after examples where they materially improve clarity.
- Acceptance checklist with test validation (`make test-unit`).

Use `###`/`####` headers only and wrap long sections in `<details>` blocks.

### 4) Update cache

After successful issue creation:

- Append `<TARGET_FILE>|<TODAY>` to `processed_files.txt`.
- Deduplicate by file path, keeping the newest date.

## Output Requirements

### If no eligible file exists

Return a success message saying all test files were analyzed in the last 30 days and include cache location.

### If analysis was completed

Return a compact summary with selected file, counts, created issue number/title, and cache update confirmation.

## Guardrails

- One file per run.
- Prefer precise recommendations over long prose.
- Follow patterns in `scratchpad/testing.md` and nearby `pkg/**/_test.go` files.
- Always update cache after successful analysis.
