# Integrity Filtering Audit

**Goal**: Audit recent agentic workflow runs in `github/gh-aw` to detect integrity
filtering anomalies, misconfigurations, or silent failures in the DIFC pipeline.

## Background

The MCP Gateway enforces Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) on all
GitHub API calls made by agentic workflows. The guard (WASM module) labels each
API response with integrity and secrecy tags. The evaluator then filters items
that violate the agent's policy.

Common problems to look for:
- **Zero DIFC events** in runs that should have filtering (proxy not intercepting)
- **Unexpected access** to out-of-scope repositories
- **Guard errors** or labeling failures in logs
- **Unscoped integrity tags** (e.g., `approved` instead of `approved:owner/repo`)
- **Empty responses** where data was expected (over-filtering)
- **Search result leaks** where out-of-scope items appear in filtered results
- **Direct API bypass attempts** where an agent contacts `api.github.com`, `github.com`,
  or external AI services (e.g., `chatgpt.com`, `openai.com`) without going through
  the MCP Gateway — these show up as network firewall blocks in the job logs

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Recent Workflow Runs

Use the GitHub CLI to list completed agentic workflow runs from the last 24 hours
in `github/gh-aw`. Focus on runs that used the MCP Gateway (look for workflows
with names containing "agent", "copilot", or that have MCP-related artifacts).

```bash
# List recent completed runs from the last 24 hours
gh run list --repo github/gh-aw --limit 50 --json databaseId,name,conclusion,createdAt,headBranch,workflowName --status completed 2>/dev/null | jq '[.[] | select((.createdAt | fromdateiso8601) > (now - 86400))]'
```

### Step 2: Download and Inspect Artifacts

For each relevant run, download the agent artifacts which contain:
- `mcp-logs/rpc-messages.jsonl` — RPC messages with DIFC metadata
- `mcp-logs/mcp-gateway.log` — Gateway operational log
- `mcp-logs/gateway.md` — Markdown-formatted gateway log

```bash
# For each run ID, download artifacts to a temp directory
ARTIFACT_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
gh run download <RUN_ID> --repo github/gh-aw --dir "$ARTIFACT_DIR" 2>/dev/null || echo "No artifacts"
```

### Step 3: Analyze DIFC Events

For each downloaded artifact set, check:

1. **JSONL integrity tags**: Parse `rpc-messages.jsonl` for entries with
   `difc_secrecy` and `difc_integrity` fields. Flag any with empty or
   unscoped tags.

2. **Filtered counts**: Look for `event: "difc_filtered"` or `filtered` entries.
   Compare the filtered count to total items — high filter ratios may indicate
   over-filtering or misconfiguration.

3. **Guard errors**: Search gateway logs for `ERROR`, `Phase .* failed`,
   `guard not initialized`, `unknown REST endpoint`, or `WASM guard trap`.

4. **WASM guard panics**: Search for `wasm error:` in gateway logs. A Rust guard
   panic produces a `wasm error: unreachable` trap. After such a trap, the guard
   marks itself permanently failed and all subsequent requests return an error until
   the gateway is restarted. Look for `WASM guard trap` entries in `mcp-gateway.log`.

5. **Scope violations**: Check if any response contains data from repositories
   NOT in the workflow's `allowed-repos` policy.

6. **Direct API bypass attempts**: Search job logs and stderr for network firewall
   blocks that reveal the agent trying to reach external domains directly instead
   of through the MCP Gateway. Key domains to flag:
   - `api.github.com` — GitHub API (must go through MCP Gateway, not curl/fetch)
   - `github.com` — GitHub web (should not be contacted directly)
   - `chatgpt.com`, `openai.com`, `api.openai.com` — external AI services
   - Any other non-allowlisted HTTP endpoint

   For each block, record: the blocked domain, the number of block events, which
   workflow run, and what step appears to have triggered it.

```bash
# Example: Count DIFC events in JSONL
grep -c 'difc_integrity' "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/mcp-logs/rpc-messages.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true

# Example: Find guard errors (including WASM traps)
grep -iE 'error|failed|blocked|unknown|wasm error:|WASM guard trap' "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/mcp-logs/mcp-gateway.log 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Example: Specifically search for WASM guard panics
grep -iE 'wasm error:|WASM guard trap|unreachable' "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/mcp-logs/mcp-gateway.log 2>/dev/null

# Example: Detect direct API bypass attempts in job logs
# The network firewall logs blocked connections; search agent stderr/stdout for clues
grep -iE 'api\.github\.com|chatgpt\.com|openai\.com|curl.*https?://[^ ]*github|fetch.*https?://[^ ]*github' \
  "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/mcp-logs/*.log 2>/dev/null | head -30

# Example: Summarize firewall blocks by domain from network-firewall logs (if present)
grep -iE 'BLOCK|DENY|firewall' "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/mcp-logs/*.log 2>/dev/null \
  | grep -oE '(api\.github\.com|github\.com|chatgpt\.com|openai\.com|[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,})' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20
```

After analyzing each artifact set, emit a DIFC event summary to the GitHub Actions step
summary so future audits can verify tag counts without downloading artifacts.
Use the same `ARTIFACT_DIR` variable defined in Step 2 above (the directory passed to
`gh run download --dir`):

```bash
# ARTIFACT_DIR is the root directory where all run artifacts were downloaded, e.g.:
#   ARTIFACT_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
#   gh run download <RUN_ID> --repo github/gh-aw --dir "$ARTIFACT_DIR"

# Write per-run DIFC event counts to the step summary
{
  echo "## DIFC Event Summary"
  echo ""
  echo "| Run | DIFC Events Labelled | DIFC Events Filtered |"
  echo "|-----|----------------------|----------------------|"

  for dir in "$ARTIFACT_DIR"/*/; do
    run_id=$(basename "$dir")
    jsonl="$dir/mcp-logs/rpc-messages.jsonl"
    if [ -f "$jsonl" ]; then
      labelled=$(grep -c '"difc_integrity"' "$jsonl" 2>/dev/null || true)
      filtered=$(grep -c '"filtered":true\|"event":"difc_filtered"' "$jsonl" 2>/dev/null || true)
      echo "| $run_id | $labelled | $filtered |"
    fi
  done
} >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

### Step 4: Classify Findings

Classify each finding by severity:
- 🔴 **Critical**: Data leak (out-of-scope data returned), guard bypass, or
  labeling failure that could expose unauthorized data
- 🟡 **Warning**: Over-filtering (legitimate data blocked), unscoped tags,
  zero DIFC events in a run that should have filtering, WASM guard trap, or
  **direct API bypass attempt** (agent contacted `api.github.com`, `github.com`,
  or an external AI service such as `chatgpt.com` / `openai.com` directly instead
  of routing through the MCP Gateway — visible as network firewall blocks)
- 🟢 **Info**: Normal filtering behavior, expected blocks, or configuration notes

**Activation job rate-limit failures** (`403 API rate limit exceeded for installation`
in the `activation` job) are an **infrastructure issue**, not a DIFC concern. The agent
was never invoked, so no MCP traffic was generated and no filtering occurred. Classify
these as 🟢 Info and note them in the Informational section. If the same workflow fails
due to rate-limits repeatedly, recommend staggering its scheduled cron time relative to
other high-frequency workflows in the repository.

When classifying a **direct API bypass** warning (W-1), record:
- The blocked domain(s) and block count
- The workflow name and run ID
- The likely cause: misconfigured `network.allowed` list, agent prompt not
  restricting tool use, or the workflow not using `tools.github` for API access
- Recommended fix: strengthen agent system prompt to use MCP Gateway tools
  exclusively; see `shared/mcp-api-routing.md` for reusable constraint language

### Step 5: Create Summary Issue

Create an issue with the audit results using the following structure:

```markdown
### Integrity Filtering Audit — ${{ github.repository }}

**Audit period**: Last 24 hours
**Runs analyzed**: [N] completed runs in github/gh-aw
**Runs with artifacts**: [N]

### Findings Summary

| Severity | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 🔴 Critical | [N] | [brief] |
| 🟡 Warning | [N] | [brief] |
| 🟢 Info | [N] | [brief] |

<details>
<summary><b>Critical Findings</b></summary>

[Details of each critical finding with run ID, workflow name, and evidence]

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Warnings</b></summary>

[Details of each warning — for direct API bypass (W-1) warnings include: blocked
domain(s), block count, workflow name, likely cause, and recommended fix]

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Informational</b></summary>

[Normal observations and stats]

</details>

### Runs Analyzed

| Run | Workflow | Branch | Agent Invoked | DIFC Events | Firewall Blocks | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| [§ID](run_url) | name | branch | ✅/❌ early-exit | N | N/total | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

### Recommendations

[Actionable suggestions based on findings. For direct API bypass (W-1) findings,
always include: 1) which workflow to investigate, 2) whether it uses
`tools.github` for API access (integrity proxy is built-in since v0.67.0),
3) whether the agent prompt restricts tool use to
MCP Gateway tools, and 4) a pointer to `shared/mcp-api-routing.md` for reusable
constraint language to add to the workflow prompt.]
```

If there are no findings (all runs look healthy), still create the issue with
a clean bill of health — this provides an audit trail.
