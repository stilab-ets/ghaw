# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation

{{#if experiments.caveman }}
Talk like a caveman in all your responses and outputs. Use short, broken sentences. Me test. You run.
{{/if}}

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Hard Limit: `add_comment` Budget

`safe-outputs.add-comment.max` is `2`. Never exceed 2 total `add_comment` calls in this run.

- Call #1 is required for the discussion interaction test (comment on latest discussion).
- Call #2 depends on trigger:
  - `pull_request` event: post the brief PR summary comment, and **skip** the fun discussion follow-up comment.
  - non-`pull_request` event: **skip** the PR summary comment and post the fun discussion follow-up comment.

## Test Requirements

Run these checks and mark each as ✅/❌:

1. `github` tool (configured with `mode: gh-proxy`): review 2 merged PRs in `${{ github.repository }}`.
2. `mcpscripts-gh`: query 2 PRs using `pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --limit 2 --json number,title,author`.
3. Serena CLI (bash only): run `serena activate_project --path ${{ github.workspace }}`, then `serena find_symbol --name_path <symbol>` and confirm at least 3 symbols.
4. Playwright CLI (bash only): run `playwright-cli open https://github.com` then `playwright-cli screenshot`; confirm successful GitHub navigation.
5. `web-fetch` tool: fetch `https://github.com` and confirm response contains `GitHub`.
6. File + bash: create `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-copilot-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with timestamped success text, then `cat` it.
7. Discussion interaction: get latest discussion with `github-discussion-query` (`limit=1`, `jq=".[0]"`), extract number, then `add_comment` to that discussion.
8. Build: run `GOCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-mod make build`.
9. Artifact upload (only if build passes): stage `./gh-aw` at `$RUNNER_TEMP/gh-aw/safeoutputs/upload-artifacts/gh-aw` and call `upload_artifact` with `path: "gh-aw"`.
10. Discussion create: call `create_discussion` in `announcements` with label `ai-generated`, title `copilot was here`, temp ID `aw_smoke_discussion`.
11. Workflow dispatch: call `dispatch_workflow` for `haiku-printer` and include `inputs.message` with an original testing/automation haiku (non-empty string).
12. PR review tools: add 1-2 inline `create_pull_request_review_comment` comments, submit review with event `COMMENT`, then reply to most recent existing review comment ID when available.
13. Comment memory: append an original 3-line haiku to `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/*.md`.
14. Sub-agent: use `file-summarizer` on `README.md`.
15. Check run: call `create_check_run` with `conclusion=success`, title `Smoke Copilot - Run ${{ github.run_id }}`, summary `All smoke tests completed.`, text `Detailed results attached.`
16. **LSP TypeScript Testing**: Use the TypeScript language server (configured via `lsp.typescript` frontmatter) to count the number of functions in `${{ github.workspace }}/actions/setup/js/safe_output_helpers.cjs`:
    - Open the file `${{ github.workspace }}/actions/setup/js/safe_output_helpers.cjs` via LSP
    - Use LSP document symbols to list all symbols in the file and count functions
    - Report the total function count as ✅ if at least 1 function is found, ❌ otherwise

## Output

1. **Create an issue** with a summary of the smoke test run:
   - Use the temporary ID `aw_smoke1` for the issue so you can reference it later
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Copilot - ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test, including test #16 LSP TypeScript)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp
     - Pull request author and assignees

2. **Set Issue Type** (**required**): Use the `set_issue_type` safe-output tool with `issue_number: "aw_smoke1"` (the temporary ID from step 1) and `issue_type: "Bug"` to set the type of the just-created smoke test issue.

3. **Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
   - PR titles only (no descriptions)
   - ✅ or ❌ for each test result
   - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
   - Mention the pull request author and any assignees

4. **Only if this workflow was NOT triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **fun and creative comment** to the newly created discussion (use the temporary ID `aw_smoke_discussion` from step 11) - be playful and entertaining in your comment

5. Use the `send_slack_message` tool to send a brief summary message (e.g., "Smoke test ${{ github.run_id }}: All tests passed! ✅")

If all tests pass and this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-copilot` to the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR)
- Use the `remove_labels` safe-output tool to remove the label `smoke` from the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR)
