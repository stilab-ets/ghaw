# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-copilot-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Copilot at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
3. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
4. **GitHub MCP Default Toolset Testing**: Verify that the `get_me` tool is NOT available with default toolsets. Try to use it and confirm it fails with a tool not found error.
5. **Cache Memory Testing**: Write a test file to `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/smoke-test-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Cache memory test for run ${{ github.run_id }}" and verify it was created successfully
6. **Web Fetch Testing**: Use the web_fetch tool to fetch content from https://api.github.com/repos/githubnext/gh-aw (verify the tool is available and returns valid JSON)
7. **Protocol Filtering Testing**: Verify that the AWF command includes protocol-specific domains in the --allow-domains flag. Check `/tmp/gh-aw/agent-stdio.log` for entries like `https://api.github.com` and `http://httpbin.org` to confirm protocol prefixes are preserved
8. **Available Tools Display**: List all available tools that you have access to in this workflow execution.
