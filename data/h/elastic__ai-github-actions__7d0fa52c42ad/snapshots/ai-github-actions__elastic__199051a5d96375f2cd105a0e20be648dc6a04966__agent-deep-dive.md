Perform a deep dive on a single agent workflow to understand how it is behaving across recent runs and surface specific, actionable recommendations.

### Pre-flight check

If `${{ env.NO_WORKFLOWS }}` is `true`, call `noop` with reason "No agentic workflows found in this repository" and stop.

### Context

- **Target workflow:** `${{ env.TARGET_WORKFLOW }}`
- **Runs analyzed:** up to `${{ inputs.run-count }}` most recent runs
- **Pre-downloaded data:**
  - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/runs.json` — run list with conclusions and links
  - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/errors.json` — error snippets from failed runs with surrounding context
  - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/logs/<run_id>/` — raw log files for each failed run

### Data Gathering

1. **Read the pre-loaded data**

   Start with:
   - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/runs.json` for the full run list and conclusions
   - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/errors.json` for structured error snippets
   - `/tmp/gh-aw/deep-dive/logs/<run_id>/` for raw agent step logs

2. **Read the workflow definition**

   Read the workflow's source `.md` file from `.github/workflows/` (e.g., if target is `trigger-pr-review.yml`, read `gh-aw-pr-review.md`). This gives you the prompt text, fragments imported, safe outputs configured, and tool permissions — necessary context for understanding why the agent behaved as it did.

3. **Trace agent tool calls in successful runs**

   For a sample of successful runs (up to 3), read the agent step logs to understand the normal tool call sequence: how many turns, which tools are used, how the agent reaches its output. This establishes a baseline.

4. **Trace tool calls in failed runs**

   For each failed run, trace the sequence of tool calls and agent responses from the agent step logs. Note:
   - Total number of tool calls
   - Repeated/redundant calls (same tool, same arguments)
   - Calls that produced errors or empty results
   - Where in the sequence the failure occurred

5. **Read the workflow's README for stated purpose and trigger**

   Find the workflow's directory under `gh-agent-workflows/` and read `README.md` to understand the intended scope and outputs. Compare against what you see in the logs.

### Analysis

Produce a thorough behavioral analysis of the target workflow. For each dimension below, describe what you actually observed in the logs:

- **Run outcomes** — summary table of recent runs (date, conclusion, run link)
- **Failure modes** — for each failed run: what step failed, exact error message, log excerpt
- **Tool call patterns** — average and outlier turn counts; which tools are called most; any tools called redundantly
- **Tool call efficiency** — are any tool calls excessive, redundant, or inappropriate given the task? Are there calls that return no useful information but are repeated? Could the same outcome be reached with fewer turns? Note specific examples of waste or unnecessary repetition.
- **Prompt adherence** — does the agent follow the workflow's instructions? Where does it deviate?
- **Output quality** — for successful runs: does the output match the expected safe-output format? Are issues/comments/PRs well-formed?
- **Recurring patterns** — note any pattern appearing in 2+ runs

### Reporting

File an issue with `create_issue`. The issue title must follow the format:
`Agent deep dive: <workflow-name> - YYYY-MM-DD`

**Issue body format:**

> ## Agent Deep Dive: `<workflow-name>`
> **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
> **Runs analyzed:** N total (X success, Y failure, Z other)
>
> ## Run Outcomes
> | Run | Date | Conclusion |
> |-----|------|------------|
> | [link](url) | date | conclusion |
>
> ## Failure Analysis
> For each failed run: step name, error excerpt, likely cause.
>
> ## Tool Call Patterns
> - Average turns per run: N
> - Most-called tools: tool1 (N times), tool2 (N times)
> - Anomalies: [any outliers or redundant calls]
>
> ## Behavioral Observations
> What the agent does well and where it struggles, with log evidence.
>
> ## Recurring Patterns
> Patterns seen in 2+ runs.
>
> ## Prompt Improvement Suggestions
> Based on the observed tool call patterns and efficiency analysis, list specific, actionable suggestions for improving the workflow prompt. For each suggestion, explain:
> - What inefficiency or problem was observed (with evidence from the logs)
> - What change to the prompt would address it
> - What improvement is expected (fewer tool calls, faster runtime, better output, etc.)

If the workflow has no recent runs at all, call `noop` with the reason.
