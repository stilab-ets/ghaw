# Daily Community Attribution Updater

Maintain an up-to-date **🌍 Community Contributions** section in `README.md`
and an all-time **Community Contributors** wiki page by attributing all
resolved community-labeled issues using the five-tier attribution strategy.

## Mission

The `community` label is the **primary attribution signal**: every issue
tagged with it was explicitly identified by a maintainer as community-authored.
This workflow attributes those issues (including direct-issue contributions
with `stateReason == "COMPLETED"`), updates `README.md`, maintains the wiki,
and opens a PR for review.

## Pre-fetched Data

All data is in `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/`. Use `cat` to read files — no
shell pipelines or data-processing scripts are needed:

```bash
# Pre-formatted README section (Tier 0-2 only — agent adds Tier 3 results):
cat /tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/readme_community_section_tier012.md

# Tier 0-2 issues grouped by author (structured JSON, agent-ready):
cat /tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/attribution_by_author.json

# Issues still needing Tier 3 agent lookup (capped at 5 per run):
cat /tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/tier3_candidates_capped.json

# Current README (pre-fetched):
head -80 /tmp/gh-aw/agent/community-data/README_current.md

# Existing wiki page (if any):
cat /tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/Community-Contributors.md
```

## Workflow

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 1. Attribute Issues

Read `attribution_by_author.json` (Tier 0–2, pre-grouped and pre-sorted — do not
re-derive). For each entry in `tier3_candidates_capped.json` (≤5), apply Tier 3
(one `issue_read` call per issue). Anything unresolved → Tier 4. Issues beyond
the first 5 in `tier3_candidates.json` are deferred to the next run — do not
process them.
{{#else}}
### 1. Attribute All Resolved Community Issues

**Tier 0, 1, and 2 attributions are already pre-computed and pre-grouped** in
`attribution_by_author.json` — do not re-derive them. Read this file directly
(using `cat`); it contains all confirmed attributions grouped by author with
issues sorted by number descending, ready for use.

For each issue in `tier3_candidates_capped.json` (at most 5 per run), apply **Tier 3** from the
imported Community Attribution Strategy (GitHub MCP `issue_read` to
look for indirect linkage via follow-up or split issues).

Any candidate still unresolved after Tier 3 becomes a **Tier 4**
"needs review" item. Issues in `tier3_candidates.json` beyond the first 5
are deferred to the next run — do not attempt to process them.
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 2. Update Wiki Page

Read the existing wiki at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/Community-Contributors.md`
(empty/missing on first run). Merge all confirmed attributions without duplicating
entries. Group by author (alphabetical), issues descending. Keep under 9 KB (remove
oldest entries from most-prolific author if needed). Format:
`- [#N](url) Title — YYYY-MM-DD — attribution_type`. Write back with edit tool.
{{#else}}
### 2. Update the Community Contributors Wiki Page

Read the existing wiki page at
`/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/Community-Contributors.md` (empty/missing on
first run).  Merge all confirmed attributions — both newly found ones and all
previously recorded ones — without duplicating entries.

> **Wiki page size limit**: Keep `Community-Contributors.md` under **9 KB**
> (hard limit is 10 KB). Check the byte size with `wc -c` before calling
> `push_repo_memory`. If the page exceeds 9 KB, remove entries to reduce it:
> sort all authors by total contribution count (descending), then remove the
> oldest entry (lowest issue number) from the author with the most entries,
> and repeat until the page is under 9 KB.

The wiki page uses issue numbers as link text for quick scanning, while `README.md`
uses issue titles. Both use full GitHub issue URLs.

The wiki page format:

```markdown
# Community Contributors

### @author

- [#N](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N) Issue title — YYYY-MM-DD — direct issue
- [#N](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N) Issue title — YYYY-MM-DD — resolved by #PR

### @author2

- [#N](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/N) Issue title — YYYY-MM-DD — direct issue
```

- Group entries by author (alphabetical order)
- Within each author section, sort by issue number descending (newest first)
- **`direct issue`** — Tier 0: closed as `COMPLETED`, no PR linkage
- **`resolved by #PR`** — Tiers 1–3: attributed to a specific merged PR
- Do not add entries for unresolved or ambiguous candidates (Tier 4)

Write the updated content back to
`/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-default/Community-Contributors.md` using the edit tool.
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 3. Build Community Section

Start from `readme_community_section_tier012.md` (pre-formatted Tier 0-2 content).
Insert Tier 3 entries (sorted, alphabetical author order). Ignore Tier 4 items
in `README.md` output. Leave a blank line after `</details>`.
{{#else}}
### 3. Build the Community Contributions Section

The pre-step has already produced a formatted starting point in
`readme_community_section_tier012.md` — read it with `cat`. This file contains
the complete Tier 0–2 `## 🌍 Community Contributions` section in the correct
format. If there are Tier 3 attributions, insert them into the bullet list
(maintaining alphabetical author order and descending issue order within each
author). Do not re-format the Tier 0–2 entries; only add new lines.

The expected format (for reference):

```markdown
## 🌍 Community Contributions

<details>
<summary>Thank you to the community members whose issue reports were resolved in this project! This list is updated automatically and reflects all attributed contributions.</summary>

- @author: #N _(direct issue)_, #N, #N _(via follow-up #M)_
- @author2: #N, #N

</details>

```

**Important**: always leave a blank line after `</details>` (as shown
above) so that the next markdown header renders correctly.

- One bullet per author, sorted alphabetically by username
- Within each author's entry, list issues in descending order (newest first), comma-separated
- **`_(direct issue)_`** (Tier 0): issue closed as `COMPLETED`, no PR linkage
- _(no suffix)_ (Tier 1/2): PR closes the issue via native close reference or keyword
- **`_(via follow-up #M)_`** (Tier 3): indirect chain through a follow-up issue
- Omit issues that cannot be attributed (Tier 4); do not render an attribution
  candidates section in `README.md`
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 4. Update README.md

Replace `## 🌍 Community Contributions` in `README.md` with the new content
(or append after `## Contributing` if absent). Use edit tool.
{{#else}}
### 4. Update README.md

Replace the existing `## 🌍 Community Contributions` section in `README.md`
with the newly generated content, or append it after the `## Contributing`
section if it does not yet exist.

Use the edit tool to make the change in-place.
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 5. Open Pull Request

If `README.md` or wiki changed: call `create_pull_request` with title
`[community] Update community contributions in README`. If no changes:
call `noop`.
{{#else}}
### 5. Open a Pull Request

If `README.md` **or** the wiki page changed, call the `create_pull_request`
safe-output tool to open a PR with the changes.

**PR title**: `[community] Update community contributions in README`

**PR body template**:
```markdown
### Community Contributions Update

Automated update to the 🌍 Community Contributions section in `README.md`
and the Community Contributors wiki page.

#### Changes
- N community issues newly attributed
- N attribution candidates flagged for review (if any)
- Wiki page updated: Y/N

#### Attribution Summary
[brief summary of what changed and how each was attributed]
```

**Important**: If no action is needed after completing your analysis, you
**MUST** call the `noop` safe-output tool with a brief explanation.

```json
{"noop": {"message": "No action needed: [brief explanation]"}}
```
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
## Token Budget

- Read each data file once only; use `cat` on pre-formatted files — no bash pipelines
- Process only `tier3_candidates_capped.json` (≤5 issues)
- One `issue_read` per Tier 3 candidate
- Stop after safe-output call
- PR body under 400 words
- Do not access external URLs; use only GitHub MCP `issue_read` for GitHub data
{{#else}}
## Token Budget Guidelines

This workflow uses the Copilot engine — max-turns is not available. Follow these rules to avoid runaway token consumption:

- **Use `cat` on pre-formatted files** — `readme_community_section_tier012.md` and `attribution_by_author.json` are ready to use directly; do not run bash pipelines or data-processing scripts on them
- **Read each data file at most once** — do not re-read `attribution_by_author.json`, `readme_community_section_tier012.md`, or `README_current.md`
- **Tier 3 cap enforced in pre-step** — `tier3_candidates_capped.json` contains at most 5 issues; process only those, then stop
- **At most 1 `issue_read` call per Tier 3 candidate** — call `issue_read` with `method: "get_comments"` once per issue to look for indirect linkage; do not chain further lookups from the results
- **Stop immediately after the safe-output call** — once `create_pull_request` or `noop` is called, halt without any further tool calls or reasoning
- **Keep the PR body under 400 words** — use `<details>` for any extended attribution summary
- **Do not access any external URLs** — use only GitHub MCP `issue_read` for GitHub data; do not call `gh api` or any external HTTP endpoints directly
{{#endif}}

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise'}}
### 6. Report Failures

On error: call `create_issue` safe-output tool with a brief title and body.
Do not use GitHub MCP `create_issue` directly.
{{#else}}
### 6. Report Failures

If you encounter a genuine error that prevents completion (e.g., data fetch failure, unexpected error), report it using the `create_issue` safe-output tool — **never use the GitHub MCP `create_issue` tool directly**. The safe-output tool has built-in deduplication (`group-by-day` and `close-older-issues`) that prevents duplicate failure issues from accumulating.

```json
{"create_issue": {"title": "Brief description of the failure", "body": "### What failed\n\nDescribe the specific step or data source that failed.\n\n### Error details\n\n(Include the error message or unexpected output here)\n\n### Steps to investigate\n\n1. Check the workflow run logs for the full error message\n2. Verify that community_issues.json and pull_requests.json were fetched successfully\n3. Re-run the workflow manually via workflow_dispatch to see if the failure is transient"}}
