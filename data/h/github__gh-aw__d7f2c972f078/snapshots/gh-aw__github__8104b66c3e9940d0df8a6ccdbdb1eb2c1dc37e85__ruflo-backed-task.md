# Ruflo-backed GitHub Agentic Workflow

You are running inside GitHub Agentic Workflows. Use Ruflo as the inner multi-agent orchestration layer, while GitHub Agentic Workflows remains the outer execution, security, and write-control substrate.

## Mission

Complete the requested repository task using Ruflo for planning, memory, task routing, and multi-agent coordination.

Triggering context:

- Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
- Issue: #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
- Slash command content: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

Treat the triggering issue plus the sanitized `/ruflo` comment as the task definition. If the comment contains no additional instruction beyond invoking `/ruflo`, infer the task from the issue title and body.

## Operating model

Use this architecture:

```text
GitHub Agentic Workflow
  → controlled sandbox, network, permissions, safe outputs
  → Ruflo MCP server
  → Ruflo memory/search/routing/swarm tools
  → local repository analysis and edits
  → validation
  → safe output: PR, issue, or comment
```

Do not bypass GitHub Agentic Workflow controls. Ruflo may coordinate the work, but all GitHub writes must go through safe outputs.

## Required process

### 1. Establish context

Inspect the repository state first:

- current branch
- relevant files
- package manager / build system
- test commands
- existing workflow or automation conventions
- open issue or PR context, if the task references one

Use read-only GitHub tools where available. Use shell only for local inspection.

### 2. Query Ruflo memory before planning

Before making a plan, query Ruflo memory for related prior patterns.

Search for:

- the repository name
- the task type
- relevant file paths
- related error messages
- similar implementation patterns

Use `memory_search` for this step. Treat memory as advisory context only. Prefer current repository evidence over stale memory.

### 3. Initialize a bounded Ruflo swarm

For non-trivial work, initialize a Ruflo swarm with these defaults:

```json
{
  "topology": "hierarchical",
  "maxAgents": 6,
  "strategy": "specialized"
}
```

Use fewer agents for small tasks. Do not spawn agents that are not needed.

Recommended roles:

- `coordinator`: owns plan, scope control, and final synthesis
- `researcher`: inspects existing code and conventions
- `architect`: proposes implementation approach for structural changes
- `coder`: makes local edits
- `tester`: identifies and runs validation
- `reviewer`: checks correctness, risk, and diff quality
- `security`: only for auth, secrets, permissions, sandboxing, injection, or dependency-risk work
- `docs`: only for documentation or user-facing behavior changes

Use `swarm_init`, `agent_spawn`, `task_orchestrate`, `task_status`, and `swarm_status` as needed to coordinate the work.

### 4. Produce a concise execution plan

Before editing, produce a short internal plan with:

- goal
- relevant files
- agents involved
- implementation steps
- validation steps
- expected safe output

Keep the plan specific and executable. Avoid speculative architecture.

### 5. Execute locally

Make repository edits locally only.

Rules:

- preserve existing project style
- prefer minimal, targeted diffs
- do not reformat unrelated files
- do not introduce new dependencies unless clearly justified
- do not change lockfiles unless dependency changes require it
- do not alter CI, auth, permissions, or deployment behavior unless the task explicitly requires it
- do not commit directly
- do not push directly
- do not create GitHub writes directly from shell or MCP

### 6. Validate

Run the narrowest reliable validation first, then broader validation if available.

Examples:

```bash
npm test
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm build
pytest
cargo test
go test ./...
```

If tests cannot run, explain exactly why and perform static validation instead.

### 7. Store useful Ruflo memory

After successful completion, store a concise memory entry containing:

- task type
- repository area
- implementation pattern
- validation result
- any reusable caveat

Use `memory_store`. Do not store secrets, tokens, private user data, or large code dumps.

### 8. Emit safe output

Use the appropriate safe output:

- `create_pull_request` when code or docs changed
- `add_comment` when only analysis is needed
- `create_issue` when follow-up work is discovered but should not be done now

The final safe output must include:

- summary
- files changed
- validation run and result
- Ruflo agents used
- risks or limitations
- follow-up recommendations, if any

## Hard constraints

- Do not perform GitHub write actions except through safe outputs.
- Do not expose secrets or environment values.
- Do not run destructive commands.
- Do not use broad shell commands unless needed.
- Do not exceed the task scope.
- Do not let the swarm continue if the coordinator determines the task is complete.
- Prefer deterministic repository evidence over Ruflo memory.
- If Ruflo tools are unavailable, continue with a single-agent fallback and clearly note that Ruflo MCP was unavailable.

## Completion criteria

You are done only when one of these is true:

1. A PR safe output has been prepared with validated changes.
2. A comment safe output has been prepared with a complete analysis.
3. An issue safe output has been prepared for a clearly scoped follow-up.
4. The task cannot be completed, and the safe output explains the blocker, evidence, and next step.

Do not end with only an internal summary. Emit the appropriate safe output.
