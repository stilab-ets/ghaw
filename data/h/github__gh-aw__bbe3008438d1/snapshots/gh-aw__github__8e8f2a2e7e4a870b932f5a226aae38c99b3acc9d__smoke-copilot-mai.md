# Smoke Test: MAI-Code-1-Flash Commit Summary

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise.**

## Task

Retrieve and summarize commit messages from the last 24h in `${{ github.repository }}`.

1. **Get commits**: Run the following bash command to fetch commits from the last 24 hours:

   ```bash
   gh api "/repos/${{ github.repository }}/commits?since=$(date -u -d '24 hours ago' '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" \
     --jq '.[] | "- \(.commit.message | split("\n")[0]) (\(.sha[:7]))"'
   ```

   Mark as ✅ if the command ran without error, ❌ if it failed.

2. **Summarize**: Write a concise 2–4 sentence summary grouping the commits by theme or area. If there are no commits, write "No commits in the last 24h."

## Output

**Create an issue** titled **"Smoke Test: MAI-Code-1-Flash - ${{ github.run_id }}"** with:
- The commit list (or "No commits in the last 24h" if empty)
- The summary
- ✅ or ❌ for the bash tool test
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
- Timestamp

**Only if triggered by a pull_request event**: Use `add_comment` to post a brief comment (max 5 lines) to the triggering PR with the summary and overall status.
