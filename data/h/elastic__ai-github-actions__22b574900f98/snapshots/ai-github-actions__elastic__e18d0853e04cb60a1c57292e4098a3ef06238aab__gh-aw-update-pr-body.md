# PR Body Update Agent

Keep the pull request body in sync with the actual state of the code changes in ${{ github.repository }}.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **PR**: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} — ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}

## Objective

Determine whether the current PR body accurately reflects the code changes in this PR. If the body contains inaccuracies — information that would actively mislead a reviewer — fix only those inaccuracies with the **minimal edit** needed. Do not rewrite, reformat, or improve the body beyond what is required to correct the specific inaccuracy.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Call `generate_agents_md` to get the repository's coding guidelines and conventions. If this fails, continue without it.
2. Call `pull_request_read` with method `get` on PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} to get the full PR details — current body, commits, and file list.
3. Call `pull_request_read` with method `get_files` to get the list of changed files.
4. If the PR description references issues (e.g., "Fixes #123", "Closes #456"), call `issue_read` with method `get` on each linked issue to understand the original motivation.

### Step 2: Analyze the Diff

Run `git log --oneline ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}..${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}` to see the commit history, then read the actual diff:

```bash
git diff --stat ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}..${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
```

For key changed files, read relevant sections to understand the scope and nature of the changes.

### Step 3: Evaluate Drift

Compare the current PR body to what the diff actually contains. The body has **significant drift** if:

1. **Missing major features or changes** — a new public API, endpoint, configuration option, or workflow was added/removed/renamed that the body doesn't mention
2. **Incorrect description** — the body describes behavior that the code no longer implements, or describes files/functions that were subsequently renamed or removed
3. **Empty or placeholder body** — the PR body is blank, a template stub, or says something like "TODO" or "add description"
4. **Scope mismatch** — the body describes a narrow fix but the diff shows broad refactoring (or vice versa), leaving reviewers without an accurate picture

Do **not** update when:
- The body is a reasonable high-level summary even if some details differ
- Only minor wording or phrasing could be improved
- The change is purely cosmetic or test-only and the body already captures the intent
- An update would erase useful context (motivation, design decisions, issue links) that the author provided
- The body could benefit from better formatting or structure but is not inaccurate
- The body omits optional detail but nothing it says is wrong

### Step 4: Update or Noop

**If there is significant drift:**

Call `update_pull_request` with a `replace` operation to write a body that:
- Makes the **minimal targeted edit** — change only the specific sentences or sections that are inaccurate, leaving the rest of the body untouched
- Preserves the original structure, formatting, and wording of unchanged sections exactly as written by the author
- Preserves the original motivation and context (including issue links like `Fixes #N`)
- Does not improve style, add new sections, or reformat content that is not inaccurate

**If the body is accurate enough:**

Call `noop` with a brief message like "PR body accurately reflects the current diff — no update needed."
