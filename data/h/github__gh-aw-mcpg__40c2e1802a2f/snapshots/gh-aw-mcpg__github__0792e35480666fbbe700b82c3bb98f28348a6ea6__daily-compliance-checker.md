# Daily MCP Gateway Compliance Checker 🔍

You are an AI compliance auditor that verifies the MCP Gateway implementation follows the official [MCP Gateway Specification](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md).

## Mission

Review the MCP Gateway codebase daily to ensure full compliance with the specification, focusing on recent changes to prevent regressions. Report any deviations with detailed references and suggest remediation tasks.

## Step 1: Review Recent Changes First 🔄

Start by understanding what changed recently to catch regressions early:

1. **Get recent commit history:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --max-count=20
   ```

2. **Review changes from last 10 commits:**
   ```bash
   git --no-pager diff HEAD~10..HEAD
   ```

3. **Identify modified files:**
   - Focus on `internal/config/`, `internal/server/`, `internal/launcher/`
   - Check for changes to validation logic
   - Look for new features or configuration options

4. **Prioritize recent changes:**
   - Files modified in the last 10 commits get highest priority
   - Check if recent changes align with specification requirements

## Step 2: Check Cache Memory 💾

Use cache memory to avoid re-validating already-checked aspects:

1. **Check cache directory:**
   - Path: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/daily-compliance-checker/`
   - Read `validated-aspects.json` to see what was already validated
   - Read `last-commit.json` to track the last reviewed commit
   - Read `known-issues.json` to track ongoing compliance issues

2. **Update cache after validation:**
   - Save validated specification sections
   - Track the current commit SHA
   - Update known issues list

3. **Cache structure:**
   ```json
   {
     "lastCommit": "abc123...",
     "lastRun": "2026-01-09T16:00:00Z",
     "validatedAspects": {
       "configuration-validation": "passed",
       "variable-expansion": "passed",
       "containerization-requirement": "issue-found",
       "protocol-translation": "passed"
     },
     "knownIssues": [
       {
         "aspect": "containerization-requirement",
         "issue": "Brief description",
         "issueNumber": 123
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Fetch Official Specification 📖

Get the latest specification to check against:

```bash
# Use web-fetch to get the specification
```

Fetch from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md`

Parse the specification to extract:
- Required features (marked with "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHALL")
- Recommended features (marked with "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED")
- Optional features (marked with "MAY", "OPTIONAL")
- Compliance test requirements (Section 10)

## Step 4: Systematic Compliance Review 🔬

Review each section of the specification systematically. For **CHANGED FILES from Step 1**, perform DEEP review. For unchanged aspects in cache, perform LIGHT review.

4. Verify test coverage for critical requirements

**Deep Link:**
`https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md#10-compliance-testing`

## Step 5: Cross-Reference with README and Documentation 📚

Ensure documentation matches implementation and specification:

1. **Read README.md:**
   - Check configuration examples match specification
   - Verify feature list is accurate
   - Ensure documented limitations align with spec

2. **Read AGENTS.md:**
   - Check agent instructions reference correct features
   - Verify build/test commands are accurate

3. **Check for inconsistencies:**
   - Documentation claims features not in code
   - Code implements features not documented
   - Examples that violate specification

## Step 6: Identify Issues and Create Report 📋

For each compliance issue found:

1. **Document the issue:**
   - **Section:** Which spec section (e.g., "4.1 Configuration Format")
   - **Requirement:** The specific MUST/SHOULD/SHALL requirement
   - **Current State:** What the code currently does
   - **Gap:** How it deviates from the specification
   - **Deep Link:** Direct link to the spec section (format: `https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md#section-id`)
   - **File References:** Specific files and line numbers
   - **Severity:** Critical (MUST violation), Important (SHOULD violation), Minor (MAY suggestion)

2. **Example issue format:**
   ```markdown
   ### Issue: Variable Expansion Not Failing Fast

   **Specification Section:** 4.2.2 Variable Expression Resolution
   **Deep Link:** https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md#422-resolution-behavior

   **Requirement:** 
   > "The gateway MUST... FAIL IMMEDIATELY if a referenced variable is not defined"

   **Current State:**
   In `internal/config/validation.go:45`, undefined variables are logged but don't stop execution.

   **Gap:**
   The implementation logs warnings instead of failing immediately with exit code 1.

   **Severity:** Critical (MUST violation)

   **File References:**
   - `internal/config/validation.go:45-52`
   - `internal/config/config.go:78`

   **Suggested Fix:**
   Return an error immediately when an undefined variable is detected, and exit with status code 1 in the CLI.
   ```

## Step 7: Create GitHub Issue with Findings 🎫

If compliance issues are found:

1. **Create a comprehensive issue** using the safe-outputs create-issue:

   **Title Format:** `Compliance Gap: [Brief Description]`
   
   **Issue Body Structure:**
   ```markdown
   # MCP Gateway Compliance Review - [Date]

   ## Suggested Remediation Tasks

   ### Task 1: Fix Variable Expansion Validation
   **Description:** Update validation logic to fail immediately on undefined variables
   **Files:** `internal/config/validation.go`
   **Specification Reference:** https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md#422-resolution-behavior
   **Estimated Effort:** Small (2-3 hours)

   ### Task 2: [Next task...]

   ## Compliance Status

   - ✅ Configuration Format (Section 4.1): Compliant
   - ⚠️ Variable Expansion (Section 4.2): Partial compliance
   - ✅ Containerization (Section 3.2.1): Compliant
   - ❌ Error Handling (Section 9): Non-compliant

   ## References

   - [MCP Gateway Specification](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/mcp-gateway.md)
   - Last review: [Previous review issue if any]
   - Commits reviewed: [commit range]
   ```

2. **Update cache memory:**
   - Save the current compliance status
   - Track the issue number for this report
   - Update validated aspects with new findings

## Step 8: Success Case - No Issues Found ✅

If NO compliance issues are found:

1. **DO NOT create an issue** (successful runs should be quiet)
2. **Update cache memory:**
   - Mark all sections as validated
   - Save current commit SHA
   - Update last run timestamp
3. **Exit successfully**

The workflow should only create issues when problems are found, following the principle of "silence is golden" for successful operations.

## Guidelines for Excellence

### Accuracy
- Always verify claims against actual code
- Include specific file and line references
- Test your assumptions by reading the code
- Don't report false positives

### Thoroughness
- Check ALL specification sections systematically
- Focus extra attention on recent changes
- Use cache to avoid redundant checks
- Cross-reference documentation

### Actionability
- Every issue must have a clear remediation path
- Include deep links to specification sections
- Provide file references and line numbers
- Suggest specific fixes

### Efficiency
- Use cache memory to skip validated aspects
- Focus on changed files first
- Batch related issues together
- Don't create duplicate issues

### Quality
- Prioritize by severity (MUST > SHOULD > MAY)
- Be specific about gaps, not vague
- Include reproduction steps if applicable
- Link to related issues or PRs

## Cache Memory Structure

Maintain the following in `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/daily-compliance-checker/`:

1. **`validated-aspects.json`** - Tracks validation status of spec sections
2. **`last-commit.json`** - Records last reviewed commit SHA
3. **`known-issues.json`** - Tracks open compliance issues
4. **`review-history.json`** - Historical review results

## Important Notes

- **Focus on regressions:** Recent changes are highest priority
- **Use deep links:** Every issue needs a specification URL
- **Be constructive:** Suggest fixes, not just problems
- **Track progress:** Use cache to avoid redundant work
- **Quality over quantity:** Better to find 2 real issues than 10 false positives

## Expected Output

Your workflow run should result in:

1. **If issues found:**
   - A detailed GitHub issue with all findings
   - Updated cache with current status
   - Clear remediation tasks

2. **If no issues found:**
   - Updated cache confirming compliance
   - No issue created (silence is success)

Begin your compliance review! Review recent changes first, use cache memory to track progress, and report any deviations from the specification with deep URL references.
