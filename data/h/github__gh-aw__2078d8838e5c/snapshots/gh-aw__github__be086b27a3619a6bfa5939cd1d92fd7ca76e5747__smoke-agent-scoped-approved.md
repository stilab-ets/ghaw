# Guard Policy Smoke Test: scoped/approved (scoped patterns)

This workflow tests a scoped guard policy with explicit repository patterns.
- `repos: ["github/gh-aw", "github/*"]` — only github org repos should be accessible
- `min-integrity: approved` — only approved content should be visible

## Instructions

Test GitHub MCP tool access under this guard policy by performing these operations and reporting results.

### Step 1: List issues from this repository (should succeed)

Use `list_issues` on `${{ github.repository }}` with `state: open` and `per_page: 3`. This is `github/gh-aw` which is in the allowed repos list. Record:
- Issue number and title
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 2: Search repositories in the github org (should succeed)

Use `search_repositories` to search for `org:github gh-aw`. These match `github/*` pattern. Record:
- Repository full name
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 3: List issues from a non-github org repository (should be blocked)

Use `list_issues` on `actions/checkout` with `state: open` and `per_page: 3`. This is NOT in the `github/*` scope so access should be denied. Record:
- Whether access was allowed or denied
- Any error message received

### Step 4: Search repositories outside github org (should be blocked)

Use `search_repositories` to search for `topic:actions org:actions` to find repos in the `actions` org. These should NOT be accessible. Record:
- Whether access was allowed or denied
- Any error message received

### Step 5: Search code in scoped repos (should succeed)

Use `search_code` to search for `guard-policies language:go repo:github/gh-aw`. This is within scope. Record:
- File paths found
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 6: Report results

Use the `add_comment` safe-output tool to post a summary to the current PR:

```json
{
  "type": "add_comment",
  "body": "## Guard Policy Test Results: `scoped/approved`\n\n### Policy\n- repos: `[\"github/gh-aw\", \"github/*\"]`\n- min-integrity: `approved`\n\n### Results\n<results from each step>\n\n### Expected\n- Steps 1, 2, 5: ALLOWED (within github/* scope)\n- Steps 3, 4: BLOCKED (outside github/* scope)"
}
```

If there is no PR context, use the `noop` tool to report the results summary.
