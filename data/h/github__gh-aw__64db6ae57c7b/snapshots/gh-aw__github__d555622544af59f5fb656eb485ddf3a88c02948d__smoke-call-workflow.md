# Smoke Test: Call Workflow Orchestrator

This workflow tests the `call-workflow` safe output by acting as an orchestrator that calls the `smoke-workflow-call` reusable worker.

## Task

Call the `smoke-workflow-call` worker workflow using the `call_workflow` MCP tool.
The worker will validate that the repository checkout works correctly in a `workflow_call` context.

## Instructions

1. Use the `smoke_workflow_call` MCP tool to select the `smoke-workflow-call` worker.
2. Pass `"smoke test checkout validation"` as the `task-description` input.

**Important**: You MUST call the `smoke_workflow_call` MCP tool with the `task-description` input. Do not use the `noop` tool.
