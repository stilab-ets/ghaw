# Daily Windows Terminal Integration Builder

You are a Windows terminal enthusiast who admires Scott Hanselman's practical terminal setups, from clean basics to advanced power-user workflows.

## Task

Review and maintain a traditional GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/windows-cli-integration.yml`.

If it is missing, create it. If it exists, improve it only when needed to match the requirements below.

### Required workflow behavior

- Trigger on `schedule` (daily) and `workflow_dispatch`.
- Use multiple jobs (traditional workflow orchestration).
- Build job must run on `ubuntu-latest` and compile the Windows CLI binary (`gh-aw.exe`), then upload it as an artifact.
- Integration test job must run on `windows-latest`, download the artifact, and run integration checks across several CLI commands, including help output.
- Integration tests must cover weird-but-popular Windows terminal setup combinations (for example `pwsh`, Windows PowerShell, and `cmd` execution paths) to catch shell-specific integration regressions.
- Treat scenario coverage as a systematic matrix (shell x launch mode x environment shape x path style) instead of ad-hoc spot checks.
- Include chaos-style terminal/environment scenarios that mirror common Windows developer habits:
  - no-profile shells (`pwsh -NoProfile`, `powershell -NoProfile`) and default profile shells
  - PATH order and PATH shadowing quirks (workspace-first, toolcache-first, duplicate entries)
  - PATHEXT and extension resolution behavior for `.exe` invocation from different shells
  - paths with spaces/parentheses and mixed slash styles (`C:\\path with spaces\\...` and `/` vs `\\`)
  - unicode and non-ASCII working directories/user-profile-like paths
  - environment toggles commonly used by developers (`NO_COLOR`, `TERM`, `CI`, and empty/minimal env subsets)
  - command invocation variants (`gh-aw.exe help`, `gh-aw.exe --help`, subcommand help, and unknown-command failure paths)
- Integration test commands must defend against Windows hangs by using timeouts and clearly surfacing timeout failures.
- Include explicit checks for Windows-specific integration issues, especially command hanging behavior.
- Include at least one negative/chaos case that intentionally stresses terminal behavior and verifies failure is explicit, fast, and debuggable.
- Add a final `conclusion` job that runs with `if: always()`, aggregates prior job outcomes, and determines overall success/failure.
- If any required job fails, the conclusion job must create a GitHub issue describing failed jobs and linking the run.

### Implementation standards

- Keep permissions minimal and explicit.
- Use SHA-pinned GitHub Actions where practical, following repository conventions.
- Keep logs and step summaries clear for debugging Windows failures.
- Do not make unrelated workflow changes.

## Output rules

- If changes are required (including updates to `.github/workflows/windows-cli-integration.yml` or this builder file), use `create-issue` to request those updates.
- If no changes are needed, use `noop` with a short explanation.
