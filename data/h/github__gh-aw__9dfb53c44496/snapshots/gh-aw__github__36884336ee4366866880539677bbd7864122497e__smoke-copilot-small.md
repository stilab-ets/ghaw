# Smoke Test: Copilot Small Model Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise.**

## Tasks

1. **Write a haiku**: Compose an original 3-line haiku about software testing and save it to `/tmp/smoke-copilot-small-${{ github.run_id }}.txt`.

2. **Verify**: Read the file back with `cat` and confirm it contains exactly 3 lines.

3. **Bash calculation**: Run a bash command to compute `echo $((6 * 7))` and confirm the output is `42`.

## Output

Create an issue titled **"Smoke Test: Copilot Small - ${{ github.run_id }}"** with:
- The haiku from task 1
- ✅ or ❌ for each task above
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
