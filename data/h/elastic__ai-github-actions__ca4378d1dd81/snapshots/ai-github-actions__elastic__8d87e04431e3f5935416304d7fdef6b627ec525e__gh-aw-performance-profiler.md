Identify performance hot paths in the repository, profile the code, and report findings with concrete before/after evidence.

**The bar is high: you must produce measurable profiling data before filing.** Most runs should end with `noop` — that means no meaningful optimization opportunity was found.

### Data Gathering

1. Detect the primary language and build system:
   - Check for `go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or similar.
   - Identify test and benchmark commands from README, CONTRIBUTING, DEVELOPING, Makefile, CI config, or similar.
2. Look for existing benchmarks:
   - **Go**: `grep -r "func Benchmark" --include="*_test.go"` for Go benchmark functions.
   - **Node.js/JS**: Search for benchmark scripts in `package.json`, or files matching `bench*`, `perf*`.
   - **Python**: Search for `pytest-benchmark`, `timeit`, or benchmark scripts.
   - **Rust**: Search for `#[bench]` or criterion benchmarks.
   - **Java**: Search for JMH benchmarks or `@Benchmark` annotations.
3. If existing benchmarks are found, run them and capture baseline results.
4. If no existing benchmarks exist, identify likely hot paths:
   - Find functions called frequently from main entry points (CLI commands, API handlers, request paths).
   - Look for loops over large data structures, repeated I/O, expensive string operations, or known anti-patterns.
   - Use `git log --since="28 days ago" --stat` to find recently changed performance-sensitive areas.
5. Check for existing performance-related issues:
   - Search `repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue (label:performance OR label:perf OR in:title "performance" OR in:title "[performance-profiler]")`.
   - If a close match exists, do not file a new issue.

### Profiling

Generate concrete profiling data — do not speculate about performance based on code reading alone.

- **Go**: Run benchmarks with `go test -bench=. -benchmem -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof -count=5`. Use `go tool pprof` to identify top functions. If no benchmarks exist, write a minimal benchmark for the identified hot path.
- **Node.js**: Use `--prof` flag or `perf_hooks` to measure execution time. Run benchmarks with multiple iterations.
- **Python**: Use `cProfile`, `timeit`, or `pytest-benchmark`. Capture function-level timing.
- **Rust**: Use `cargo bench` with criterion or the built-in bench harness. Capture timing and throughput.
- **Java**: Use JMH benchmarks. Capture throughput and average time.
- For other languages, use the idiomatic profiling tool for that ecosystem.

Always capture **baseline numbers** before making any change.

### Optimization

1. Based on profiling data, identify the single most impactful optimization opportunity.
2. Implement the smallest safe change that improves the hot path. Examples:
   - Replace O(n²) algorithm with O(n log n) or O(n).
   - Reduce unnecessary allocations (pre-allocate slices, reuse buffers).
   - Cache repeated computations.
   - Avoid redundant I/O or network calls.
   - Replace expensive regex with string operations where possible.
   - Use more efficient data structures (maps vs linear search).
3. Re-run the same profiling or benchmark to capture **after** numbers.
4. Verify existing tests still pass — run the most relevant test command(s).

### What to Report

Only file an issue if **all** of these are true:
- You have concrete before/after benchmark or profiling numbers.
- The improvement is **not trivial** (at least 10% improvement in time or memory for the hot path, or measurably significant for high-frequency operations).
- Existing tests pass after the change.
- The change is behavior-preserving — no functional regressions.

### What to Skip

- Micro-optimizations with <10% improvement — not worth a human's time to review.
- Theoretical performance concerns without profiling data — **no "this looks slow."**
- Optimizations that sacrifice readability for marginal gains.
- Changes that alter public APIs or behavior.
- Performance issues already tracked by an open issue.

### Quality Gate — When to Noop

Call `noop` if any of these are true:
- No existing benchmarks were found and you could not write a meaningful one.
- Profiling did not reveal a clear hot path.
- The best optimization you found yields less than 10% improvement.
- You could not verify that existing tests still pass after the change.
- A similar issue is already open.
- The repository has no performance-sensitive code paths worth optimizing.

### Issue Format

**Issue title:** Short description of the optimization opportunity

**Issue body:**

> ## Hot Path
> [Which function/code path is the bottleneck, with file path and line numbers]
>
> ## Profiling Data
> **Before:**
> ```
> [Baseline benchmark or profiling output]
> ```
>
> ## Proposed Change
> [Description of the optimization, with a diff or code snippet]
>
> ## Results
> **After:**
> ```
> [Post-optimization benchmark or profiling output]
> ```
>
> **Improvement:** [Percentage improvement in time/memory/throughput]
>
> ## Verification
> - [Tests run and their results]
> - [Confirmation that behavior is preserved]
>
> ## Evidence
> - [Commands run, full profiling output, file references]

### Labeling

- If a `performance` label exists (check with `github-get_label`), include it in the `create_issue` call. Otherwise, if `performance-profiler` exists, use that. If neither exists, rely on the `[performance-profiler]` title prefix only.
