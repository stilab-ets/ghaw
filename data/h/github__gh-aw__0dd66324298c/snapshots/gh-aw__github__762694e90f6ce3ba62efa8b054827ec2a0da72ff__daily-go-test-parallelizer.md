# Daily Go Test Parallelizer

Analyze up to twenty-five Go test files per run and add `t.Parallel()` only where parallel execution is demonstrably safe.

## Select a file

1. Use `grep` to list tracked `*_test.go` files containing top-level `Test` functions. Exclude `vendor/` and generated files, then sort paths lexicographically.
2. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/go-test-parallelizer/state.json` when it exists. It has this shape:
   `{"last_file":"path/to/file_test.go"}`.
3. Select up to 25 consecutive paths starting after `last_file`, wrapping to the first path. If the cache is absent, malformed, or names a removed file, start from the first path.
4. Analyze and modify only this selected batch (maximum 25 files).
5. Minimize token usage: avoid re-reading files you already analyzed, and do not paste full file contents into notes or outputs.

## Analyze safety

Add `t.Parallel()` at the start of eligible top-level tests. Also add it to eligible table-driven subtests when loop variables are safely captured.

## Inline analysis agents (small context)

1. For each selected path, call `parallel-safety-checker` exactly once with only that file path and the safety rules from this workflow.
2. Dispatch these inline agent calls in one parallel tool-use block when possible. If not possible, dispatch in small batches of 5.
3. Require compact JSON output from each sub-agent:
   `{"file":"...","safe":true|false,"reasons":["..."],"candidate_tests":["TestName"]}`.
4. Use the JSON results to decide which files to edit. Keep aggregation notes short and avoid repeating unchanged rule text.

Do not parallelize tests that use or may conflict through:

- `t.Setenv`, `os.Setenv`, `os.Chdir`, or other process-wide state
- shared mutable globals, singleton state, ordering assumptions, or package-level mocks
- fixed ports, fixed filesystem paths, shared databases, or shared external services
- unsafe loop-variable capture, timing dependencies, or explicit synchronization between tests

Do not change assertions, test behavior, production code, dependencies, generated files, or vendored files. When safety is uncertain, make no change.

## Validate

After editing the selected batch:

1. Run `go test -race` once per unique modified package (deduplicate package paths across edited files).
2. Run `go test ./...` once after all candidate edits.
3. Inspect the diff and confirm it contains only safe `t.Parallel()` additions in selected files.
4. Revert the edit and use `noop` if any test command fails or the diff contains any other change.

## Persist and report

Always create `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/go-test-parallelizer/` and write the last path from the selected batch to `state.json`, even when no edit is safe, so the next daily run advances round-robin.

If validation succeeds with a change, create one draft pull request describing the safety analysis and test results. Otherwise use `noop` with the selected path and a short reason.

model: gpt-5-mini

Given one `*_test.go` file path, read only that file and apply this workflow's safety rules.
Return compact JSON only in this exact shape:
`{"file":"...","safe":true|false,"reasons":["..."],"candidate_tests":["TestName"]}`.
Set `safe` to false when uncertain.
