# Smoke Agent: assign-to-agent with agentic-workflows

This workflow validates that `assign-to-agent` works correctly with the `agentic-workflows` custom agent.

## Instructions

1. **Find a Smoke issue**: Use the GitHub MCP tools to search for an open issue in ${{ github.repository }} whose title starts with "Smoke". Use the search query: `is:issue is:open in:title Smoke repo:${{ github.repository }}`. Pick the first result.

2. **Assign the issue**: Use the `assign_to_agent` safe-output tool to assign the issue to copilot using the `agentic-workflows` custom agent:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "assign_to_agent",
     "issue_number": <issue_number>,
     "agent": "copilot"
   }
   ```

3. **Report**: Add a brief comment to the current pull request confirming the issue number that was assigned and which agent was used.

If no Smoke* issue is found, use the `noop` tool to report that no matching issue was found.
