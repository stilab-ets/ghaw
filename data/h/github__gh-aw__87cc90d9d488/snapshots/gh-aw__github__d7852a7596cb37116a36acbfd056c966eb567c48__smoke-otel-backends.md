# Smoke Test: OTEL Backends

Validate the full OTEL loop for this repository:

1. gh-aw emits spans through the shared OTEL configuration.
2. The local OTEL mirror shows spans for this run.
3. Sentry can be queried for recent gh-aw telemetry.
4. Grafana can be queried for recent gh-aw telemetry.

The goal is to verify the current run end to end, not just prove that the backends contain some older telemetry.

Step 1 keeps that local OTEL infrastructure coverage by explicitly checking env injection, the local JSONL mirror, span emission for the current run, and zero OTLP export errors before any remote backend queries begin.

## Required Secrets

This workflow expects these secrets to be present:

- `GH_AW_OTEL_SENTRY_ENDPOINT`
- `GH_AW_OTEL_SENTRY_HEADERS`
- `GH_AW_OTEL_GRAFANA_ENDPOINT`
- `GH_AW_OTEL_GRAFANA_HEADERS`
- `SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `GRAFANA_URL`
- `GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`

## Rules

- Keep the investigation narrow and execution-oriented.
- Use the OTEL query playbook from `shared/otel-queries.md`.
- Prefer proving the current run is visible in each backend.
- Distinguish `pass`, `fail`, and `inconclusive` explicitly.
- Do not browse unrelated dashboards, issues, or traces.
- Always complete the workflow in this order: Step 1 local OTEL checks, Step 2 Sentry, then Step 3 Grafana.
- Do not skip Grafana because Sentry failed or consumed time. Report both backends in the same run.

## Status model

- `pass`: the current run is visible and the read or write path worked.
- `inconclusive`: the backend can be queried and recent `gh-aw` spans exist, but this run is not yet visible.
- `fail`: emit-side or read-side behavior is broken.

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify local OTEL emission

Use bash to verify the send side for this run.

Run these checks:

```bash
echo "=== OTEL environment ==="
echo "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT:+set}"
echo "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS:+set}"
echo "GH_AW_OTLP_ENDPOINTS=${GH_AW_OTLP_ENDPOINTS:+set}"
echo "OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=${OTEL_SERVICE_NAME:-}"
echo "COPILOT_OTEL_FILE_EXPORTER_PATH=${COPILOT_OTEL_FILE_EXPORTER_PATH:-}"

echo "=== OTEL local mirror ==="
if [ -f /tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl ]; then
  wc -l /tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl
  jq -c '.resourceSpans[]?.scopeSpans[]?.spans[]? | {name, traceId}' /tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl | head -10
  echo "=== Current run markers in local mirror ==="
  jq -c '.resourceSpans[]? as $rs | ([($rs.resource.attributes[]? | select(.key == "github.run_id") | .value.stringValue)] | first // "") as $run_id | $rs.scopeSpans[]?.spans[]? | {name, run_id: $run_id}' /tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl | grep '"run_id":"${{ github.run_id }}"' | head -5 || true
else
  echo "otel.jsonl missing"
fi

echo "=== OTEL export errors ==="
if [ -f /tmp/gh-aw/otlp-export-errors.count ]; then
  cat /tmp/gh-aw/otlp-export-errors.count
else
  echo 0
fi
```

Decide:

- `send_status = pass` only if OTEL env vars are present, `/tmp/gh-aw/otel.jsonl` exists with at least one span for `${{ github.run_id }}`, and the OTLP export error count is zero.
- `send_status = inconclusive` if spans exist locally but none for `${{ github.run_id }}` can be confirmed.
- Otherwise set `send_status = fail` and record the exact missing artifact or error.

### Step 2: Query Sentry

Use the Sentry MCP tools configured in this workflow.

1. Discover the organization and project for `${{ github.repository }}`.
2. Query recent telemetry for the last 24 hours.
3. First try to find spans for the current run using `${{ github.run_id }}` plus `service.name=gh-aw` when the MCP tool supports those filters.
4. If the current run is not visible, run a fallback query for `gh-aw` spans from the last 24 hours to distinguish ingestion delay from a broken Sentry query path.

Record all of the following:

- whether the MCP connection worked
- whether a project was found for this repository
- whether current-run spans were found
- whether recent `gh-aw` spans were found even if current-run spans were not
- one representative trace, event, or span link when available

Set:

- `sentry_status = pass` when query access works and current-run spans are visible
- `sentry_status = inconclusive` when query access works and recent `gh-aw` spans are visible but this run is not yet visible
- `sentry_status = fail` otherwise

### Step 3: Query Grafana

Use the Grafana MCP server configured in this workflow.

1. Inspect the available Grafana tracing tools first.
2. Discover the tracing datasource or Tempo surface that contains `gh-aw` spans.
3. Query the last 24 hours of traces.
4. First try to locate spans for `${{ github.run_id }}`.
5. If the current run is not visible, fall back to recent `service.name=gh-aw` spans to distinguish ingestion delay from a broken Grafana query path.

Record all of the following:

- whether the MCP connection worked
- which tracing datasource or tool was used
- whether current-run spans were found
- whether recent `gh-aw` spans were found even if current-run spans were not
- one representative trace, query, or panel reference when available

Set:

- `grafana_status = pass` when query access works and current-run spans are visible
- `grafana_status = inconclusive` when query access works and recent `gh-aw` spans are visible but this run is not yet visible
- `grafana_status = fail` otherwise

### Step 4: Final verdict

Compute the overall result:

- `PASS` only when `send_status`, `sentry_status`, and `grafana_status` all pass
- `INCONCLUSIVE` when no status is `fail` but at least one status is `inconclusive`
- otherwise `FAIL`

## Output

Create exactly one GitHub issue with:

- Draft the body locally first if needed, but emit only one final `create_issue` safe output after the full report is complete.
- Never create a placeholder, empty, `-`, or partial issue body.
- Do not retry `create_issue`: this workflow allows only one issue, so a premature call leaves the final report empty.
- Title: `Smoke Test: OTEL Backends - ${{ github.run_id }}`
- A short executive summary with overall `PASS`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, or `FAIL`
- A markdown table with one row for `Local OTLP`, one row for `Sentry`, and one row for `Grafana`, using these exact columns: `Backend`, `Write Config Present`, `Write Export Succeeded`, `Read Config Present`, `Read Query Succeeded`, `Overall`
- Use `✅` for pass, `❌` for fail, `🔶` for inconclusive, and `—` where a cell does not apply
- For the `Local OTLP` row, map `Write Config Present` to OTEL env vars being injected and map `Write Export Succeeded` to the local JSONL mirror containing current-run spans with zero export errors.
- Use this table form:

  ```markdown
  | Backend | Write Config Present | Write Export Succeeded | Read Config Present | Read Query Succeeded | Overall |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Local OTLP | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | ✅ |
  | Sentry | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🔶 | 🔶 |
  | Grafana | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
  ```

- The exact evidence used for each backend
- A `## Failure Analysis` section after the table
- The run URL: `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`

For every unchecked cell in the table, add a dedicated subsection under `## Failure Analysis` that explains:

- the exact failing step
- the evidence you observed
- the most likely root cause
- whether the problem is on the write path, read path, auth, configuration, propagation, or the backend itself
- the next concrete debug step or fix

Do not stop after the first failure. Report the full Sentry and Grafana matrix even if one backend is completely broken.
