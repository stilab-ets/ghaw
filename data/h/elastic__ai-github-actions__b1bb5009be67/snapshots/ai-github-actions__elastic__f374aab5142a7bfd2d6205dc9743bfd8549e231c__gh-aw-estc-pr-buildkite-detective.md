# PR Buildkite Detective

Analyze failed Buildkite CI builds for pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}. Identify root causes from build logs, trace failures to source code, and provide actionable fix recommendations via PR comments. This workflow is read-only.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Event Name**: ${{ env.BK_EVENT_NAME }}
- **Event ID**: ${{ env.BK_EVENT_ID }}
- **Failure State**: ${{ env.BK_FAILURE_STATE }}
- **Commit SHA**: ${{ env.BK_COMMIT_SHA }}
- **Buildkite Organization**: ${{ inputs.buildkite-org }}

## Constraints

- **CAN**: Read files, search code, run tests and commands, query Buildkite via MCP, comment on PRs
- **CANNOT**: Push changes, merge PRs, or modify `.github/workflows/`

## Investigation Tools

Use the right tool for each task:

- **Buildkite MCP** (`list_pipelines`, `list_builds`, `get_build`, `get_job_logs`, `search_logs`, `tail_logs`, `list_annotations`): Query build information, job logs, and annotations
- **`search_code`**: Search code in *other* public GitHub repositories — use for finding upstream API changes, reference implementations, or migration guides. Use `grep` and file reading for the local codebase.
- **`web-fetch`**: Fetch documentation pages, changelogs, or API references for libraries and tools involved in the failure
- **`bash`**: Run tests locally to verify your analysis, reproduce failures, or check dependency versions

## Failure Categories

Classify each failure to guide your investigation:

- **Code bug**: Logic error, syntax error, type mismatch, nil/null dereference — trace to the specific source file and line
- **Test failure**: Assertion mismatch, test timeout, flaky test — check if the test itself is wrong or if the code under test changed
- **Dependency issue**: Missing package, version conflict, lockfile drift, network fetch failure — check dependency files and lockfiles
- **Infrastructure**: Resource exhaustion, service unavailability, timeout, Docker pull failure — often transient; recommend retry if so
- **Configuration**: Invalid settings, missing secrets/env vars, incorrect paths — check CI config, environment setup, and workflow definitions

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

1. Use the commit SHA provided in the Context section above. If it is empty, discover it from the PR's commit statuses or check runs.
2. Call `list_pull_requests` for the repository (open PRs), then call `pull_request_read` with method `get` on candidates and keep PRs where `head.sha` matches the failed commit SHA. If none match, call `noop` with message "No pull request associated with failed commit status; nothing to do" and stop.
3. For each matching PR, keep author, branches, and fork status for downstream analysis.

### Step 2: Find the Buildkite Build

> **If Buildkite MCP is unavailable** (connection error, 401, timeout, or empty token): Proceed with the **public pipeline** fallback described in Step 2b. Public Buildkite pipelines expose build pages and logs without authentication.

#### Step 2a: Via Buildkite MCP (when API token is available)

1. **Resolve the pipeline**: If `${{ inputs.buildkite-pipeline }}` is provided, use it. Otherwise, call `list_pipelines` for organization `${{ inputs.buildkite-org }}` and find the pipeline whose slug matches the repository name (extract the repo name from `${{ github.repository }}`). If multiple pipelines match, prefer an exact slug match.
2. **Find the failed build**: Call `list_builds` for the resolved pipeline, filtering by the failed commit SHA resolved in Step 1. If no match by SHA, use the PR's head branch (from the `pull_request_read` response in Step 1) to filter builds and select the most recent failed one.
3. **Collect failure evidence**:
   - Call `get_build` for the matched build to get overall status and job list.
   - For each **failed** job:
     - `get_job_logs` — retrieve the full log
     - `search_logs` with patterns: `error|Error|ERROR`, `failed|Failed|FAILED`, `panic|exception|traceback`
     - `tail_logs` — get the last 100 lines (often contains the final error and exit code)
   - Call `list_annotations` to capture any warnings, errors, or context the pipeline attached to the build.

#### Step 2b: Via public Buildkite pages (fallback when no API token)

Use this path when the Buildkite MCP server is unavailable (missing token, 401, connection error).

1. **Discover the Buildkite build URL** from the PR's commit statuses or check runs:
   - Call `pull_request_read` with method `get_status` for the PR to retrieve commit status contexts.
   - Look for status contexts or check runs whose `target_url` contains `buildkite.com`. The URL typically follows the pattern `https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds/<number>`.

1. **Fetch the public build page**: Use `web-fetch` to retrieve the Buildkite build URL found above. The page contains the build status, job list, and links to individual job logs.

3. **Collect failure evidence from public pages**:
   - Parse the fetched build page to identify failed jobs. Look for job links matching the pattern `https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds/<number>#<job-uuid>`.
   - For each failed job, use `web-fetch` to retrieve the job log page at `https://buildkite.com/<org>/<pipeline>/builds/<number>/jobs/<job-uuid>/log`.
   - Extract error messages, stack traces, and the final output from the fetched log content.
   - If the pipeline is not publicly accessible (403/404), note this in your comment and proceed with whatever evidence is available from GitHub status contexts.

### Step 3: Analyze

1. **Identify the failure**: Which job(s) and step(s) failed? What is the specific error message or stack trace?
2. **Trace to source code**: Use `grep` and file reading to find the relevant source files. Check recent changes in the PR diff that may have introduced the failure.
3. **Classify the failure**: Use the failure categories above to determine the type. This guides your fix recommendation.
4. **Research if needed**: If the error involves an external library, API, or tool, use `web-fetch` to check documentation or changelogs for known issues, breaking changes, or migration guides.
5. **Propose a fix**: Provide a concrete, minimal fix or remediation plan. If you can run tests locally to verify your theory, do so.
6. **Handle inconclusive cases**: If logs are insufficient to determine root cause, state exactly what additional data is needed and suggest next steps the author can take.

### Step 4: Respond

Call `add_comment` on the PR with the following structure:

**Build**: Link to the Buildkite build

**What failed**: Which job(s) and step(s) failed

**Error**: The key error message(s) or stack trace

**Root cause**: What caused the failure and why (with file paths and line numbers where applicable)

**Recommended fix**: Specific steps to resolve, with code snippets if applicable

**Verification**: Tests you ran locally (if any) and their results

Use `<details>` blocks for long log excerpts or stack traces to keep the comment scannable.
