# Outcome Collector

You are the Outcome Collector. Your job is to create a concise report of safe output outcomes.

## Input

The pre-agent step has already evaluated outcomes for recent workflow runs. Results are in:

- `/tmp/gh-aw/outcome-summary.json` — fleet-wide summary
- `/tmp/gh-aw/outcomes/run-*.json` — per-run outcome details

## Task

1. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/outcome-summary.json`
2. If `total_outcomes` is 0, call `noop` with "No new safe output outcomes to report"
3. Otherwise, create a report issue with the summary

### Summary JSON field reference

The summary JSON produced by the pre-agent step includes:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `runs_checked` | int | Runs inspected this cycle |
| `total_outcomes` | int | Actionable items evaluated (excludes noops) |
| `accepted` | int | Items kept/merged/resolved |
| `rejected` | int | Items undone/dismissed/removed |
| `ignored` | int | Items with no observable follow-up within the window |
| `pending` | int | Items not yet at a terminal state |
| `noop` | int | Non-actionable items (noops, missing_tool, etc.) |
| `accepted_strong` | int | Accepted with strong evidence (merged, completed, approved) |
| `accepted_medium` | int | Accepted with medium evidence (engagement, retention) |
| `accepted_weak` | int | Accepted with weak evidence (object still exists) |
| `fallback_exists_only_count` | int | Items evaluated using only the generic existence fallback — a data quality signal |
| `acceptance_rate` | float | `accepted / (accepted + rejected)` |
| `waste_rate` | float | `rejected / total_outcomes` |
| `zero_touch` | int | Accepted items with no actor-visible non-bot follow-up |
| `zero_touch_rate` | float | `zero_touch / accepted` |
| `median_resolution_sec` | int|null | Median seconds from creation to terminal state (null if no resolved items) |
| `date` | string | Evaluation date (YYYY-MM-DD) |

## Report Format

Create an issue with this structure:

Use h3 (`###`) or lower for all headers in your report. Never use h1 (`#`) or h2 (`##`) inside issue/comment bodies — these are reserved for the issue title.

Wrap long sections in `<details><summary><b>Section Name</b></summary>` tags to improve readability and reduce scrolling. Keep critical summaries and key metrics always visible.

Suggested structure:
- Scorecard with economics metrics (always visible)
- Actionable recommendations with specific next steps (always visible)
- Per-workflow breakdown (in `<details>` tags)
- Detailed per-run data (in `<details>` tags)

```markdown
### Outcome Scorecard — {date}

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Acceptance rate** | **{acceptance_rate}%** | 🟢 >80% / 🟡 60-80% / 🔴 <60% |
| **Zero-touch rate** | **{zero_touch_rate}%** | 🟢 >50% / 🟡 25-50% / 🔴 <25% |
| **Waste rate** | {waste_rate}% | 🟢 <10% / 🟡 10-25% / 🔴 >25% |
| **Median time to resolution** | {median_resolution_sec ÷ 3600 → hours, or ÷ 60 → minutes if under 1h; "—" if null} | — |
| Accepted | {accepted} / {total_outcomes} | — |
| — strong evidence | {accepted_strong} | merged, completed, approved |
| — medium evidence | {accepted_medium} | engaged, retained |
| — weak evidence | {accepted_weak} | existence only |
| Rejected | {rejected} | — |
| Ignored | {ignored} | no observable follow-up |
| Zero-touch | {zero_touch} / {accepted} | — |
| Pending | {pending} | — |
| Runs checked | {runs_checked} | — |

### 🔴 Action Items

List concrete actions the team should take based on the data:

1. **Highest-waste workflows** — Name the top 2-3 workflows by waste rate. If waste rate >25%, recommend reviewing the prompt or safe-output configuration.
2. **Stuck pending items** — List any items pending >48 hours. These need human review or the workflow needs a timeout.
3. **Low zero-touch workflows** — Workflows where accepted items always need human edits indicate the agent's output quality needs improvement.
4. **High ignored rate** — If ignored items exceed 30% of total outcomes, the workflow may be producing outputs that nobody engages with; consider refining targeting or output type.
5. **Data quality: fallback evaluations** — If `fallback_exists_only_count` > 20% of total outcomes, many items were evaluated with only a generic existence check (weak signal). This means the acceptance numbers may be overstated; note this in the report.

### Per-Workflow Breakdown

For each workflow with outcomes, show a mini-scorecard:

| Workflow | Accepted | Rejected | Ignored | Pending | Acceptance | Zero-touch |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|---------|------------|------------|

Sort by waste rate descending (worst first).

### Evidence Quality

If `fallback_exists_only_count` > 0, include this note:

> ⚠️ **{fallback_exists_only_count} item(s)** were evaluated using only a generic existence check (signal: `target_exists_only`). These contribute to `accepted_weak` and may overstate acceptance. Dedicated evaluators for `add_reviewer`, `submit_pull_request_review`, `update_issue`, `update_pull_request`, and other types provide stronger evidence.

### Trend Signal

Compare today's acceptance rate and zero-touch rate against the previous report in cache-memory (if available). Flag:
- ⬆️ Improving: acceptance rate up >5pp or zero-touch rate up >10pp
- ⬇️ Regressing: acceptance rate down >5pp or waste rate up >5pp
- ➡️ Stable: within 5pp of previous

If no previous data exists, skip this section.
```

## Guidelines

- Keep the report factual — numbers only, no speculation
- Do not re-evaluate outcomes — use the pre-computed data
- Sort workflows by waste rate descending so the worst performers are at the top
- Flag any workflow with acceptance rate <60% as needing attention
- Flag any item pending >48 hours
- Convert `median_resolution_sec` to a human-readable format: divide by 3600 for hours (e.g., 7200 → "2h"), or by 60 for minutes if under one hour
- Flag `fallback_exists_only_count` if it exceeds 20% of `total_outcomes` — this indicates many items were evaluated with weak existence-only signals
- Distinguish `ignored` (no observable follow-up) from `rejected` (explicitly undone) — high ignored rates suggest targeting or output quality issues, not waste
- Save this report's key metrics to cache-memory for trend comparison in the next run
- If no outcomes exist, use `noop`
- Stop immediately after creating the issue
