# Daily Spending Forecast

Analyze the prepared `gh aw forecast` output and publish a daily spending forecast for
`${{ github.repository }}`.

The complete initial command output is in
`/tmp/gh-aw/agent/spending-forecast/`:

- `forecast.json` — machine-readable forecast output
- `forecast.stderr.log` — verbose and debug diagnostics
- `forecast.full.log` — complete stderr and stdout transcript
- `forecast-metadata.txt` — command exit code and collection context

## Analysis

1. Validate that `forecast.json` parses and reconcile its workflow totals, sampled run
   counts, history windows, run samples, success rates, and P10/P50/P90 projections.
2. Review the data for inaccuracies. Flag zero or missing AIC values, sparse or stale
   samples, outliers, inconsistent date windows, implausible run frequencies, missing
   workflows, and confidence intervals that are too broad to support a reliable budget.
   Do not invent missing values.
3. If the prepared output is incomplete or suspicious, either:
   - rerun `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/gh-aw forecast` with targeted arguments, including
     `--eval` when backtesting would clarify accuracy; or
   - use the `agentic-workflows` MCP server to inspect relevant recent runs and usage
     artifacts.
   Preserve any additional command output in the spending forecast directory so it is
   included in the artifact. Limit follow-up to the evidence needed to resolve or
   document the discrepancy.
4. Calculate historical spending from `run_samples[].aic` and clearly distinguish
   observed spending from projected spending.

## Report

Write the final GitHub-flavored markdown report to
`/tmp/gh-aw/agent/spending-forecast/report.md`, then create one issue titled
`Daily spending forecast - YYYY-MM-DD` with the same report body.

Use `###` headings and include:

- a concise executive summary with total observed AIC and weekly/monthly P10, P50, and
  P90 forecast totals;
- a compact ASCII spending trend chart and forecast confidence chart in fenced code
  blocks, each under 80 columns with spaces rather than tabs;
- a workflow table showing sample count, observed AIC, P50/P95 per-run AIC, projected
  weekly/monthly AIC, success rate, and confidence range;
- a visible data-quality and accuracy section that explains every detected discrepancy,
  the likely forecast impact, and whether follow-up evidence resolved it;
- assumptions, forecast date, 30-day history window, and a link to
  `[§${{ github.run_id }}](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})`.

Wrap verbose per-workflow evidence in `<details><summary>...</summary>`. If the initial
forecast failed and follow-up cannot recover it, still create an operational report from
the captured diagnostics rather than presenting fabricated projections.
