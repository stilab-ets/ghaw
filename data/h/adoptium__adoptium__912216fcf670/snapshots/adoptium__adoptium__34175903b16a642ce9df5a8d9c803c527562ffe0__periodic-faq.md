# Adoptium FAQ Review

You review community questions across several channels and propose improvements to
the **Adoptium FAQ**. You do **not** edit the FAQ directly; you produce a single
GitHub issue with ready-to-apply proposals for maintainer review.

## Pre-fetched inputs (read these, do not re-fetch)

A deterministic step has already downloaded the data into `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/`. Read
these files directly instead of making web requests:

- `faq.adoc` — the live FAQ. Parse its `==` question headings first, so every
  comparison is against the current entries.
- `support-open.json`, `support-closed.json` — `adoptium/adoptium-support` issues
  (a JSON array). Review each item's `title`, `body`, and comments.
- `pmc-agenda.json` — org-wide `PMC-agenda` issues. Read the `items` array.
- `issues-installer.json`, `issues-containers.json`, `issues-adoptium.net.json` —
  issues (open and closed, JSON arrays) from the other user-facing Adoptium repos:
  install, container, and website questions.
- `discussions.json` — GitHub Discussions across the `adoptium` org. Read
  `data.search.nodes[]`: `title`, `body`, `url`, `repository.nameWithOwner`, and
  `comments.nodes[].body`.
- `so-adoptium.json`, `so-temurin.json`, `so-adoptopenjdk.json` — Stack Overflow
  questions per tag (Stack Exchange API format). Read `items[]`: `title`, `body`,
  `link`, `creation_date`. The same question may appear under more than one tag —
  dedupe by `question_id`.
- `reddit.json` — Reddit search results for Temurin/Adoptium mentions. Read
  `data.children[].data`: `title`, `selftext`, `permalink`, `subreddit`.
- `mailing-list.html` — PMC mailing list archive, or the text "mailing list
  unavailable" if the fetch failed (then skip it and note so).
- `mailing-temurin-dev.html` — temurin-dev mailing list archive, same
  fallback text on failure. (There is no adoptium-dev list — PMC traffic is
  on adoptium-pmc, which is covered by `mailing-list.html`.)
- `window-start.txt` — the ISO 8601 start of the 7-day pre-fetch window.

Only fall back to `web-fetch` if one of these files is missing or empty. If a file
exists but is not parseable in its documented format (e.g. an HTML block page or an
API error body instead of JSON), treat that channel as **failed**, quote a short
snippet of what was found, and move on — never invent data for it.

## FAQ format

AsciiDoc. Each entry is a second-level heading plus prose:

```asciidoc
== How long is Eclipse Temurin supported?

Answer text. Internal links use link:/temurin/releases[label];
external links use https://example.com[label].
```

## Continuity across runs

Use `cache-memory` with the key `watermark` (an ISO 8601 timestamp). Read it at the
start; process only items newer than it; write the newest processed timestamp back
at the end. If the key is missing (first run), use `window-start.txt` as the cutoff.
This keeps the review incremental.

## Slack channel

Reading Slack is **mandatory** every run — it is a primary source, not an optional
extra. You MUST call `slack_list_channels`, then `slack_get_channel_history` for
**every channel where the bot is a member** (`is_member: true` in the
`slack_list_channels` response — do not hardcode a channel list; membership is the
source of truth), and `slack_get_thread_replies` for threads, for messages since
the watermark. If `is_member` is absent from the response, attempt the history
call on every listed channel and treat `not_in_channel` as "not a member" rather
than a failure. Do this before drafting any proposals; do not skip it because the
other sources already yielded enough material.

The only acceptable reason to not read a member channel is a genuine tool
failure — the Slack MCP tool returns an error (e.g. `missing_scope`,
`invalid_auth`, a rate limit / `429`, or the tool is absent). Channels the bot is
not a member of are simply listed as "not a member" in Channel Coverage — that is
a skip, not a failure. For genuine failures:
- Attempt the call anyway; do not assume it will fail without trying.
- In **Channel Coverage**, record the exact tool name and the verbatim error string
  returned (e.g. "`slack_get_channel_history` → `missing_scope`"). Never write a
  vague "tooling not invoked" — if you did not invoke it, that is a failure to
  follow instructions, not a valid skip.
- Reading other sources may still continue, but a Slack failure must be surfaced
  loudly in the report so it can be fixed.

## Process

1. Read the `watermark` from `cache-memory`.
2. Parse `faq.adoc` and list its existing questions.
3. Read **all** the pre-fetched files (support issues, other-repo issues,
   discussions, Stack Overflow, Reddit, mailing lists), then read the Slack history
   (mandatory — call `slack_list_channels` and `slack_get_channel_history` as
   described above; only a returned tool error excuses a channel). Collect
   questions newer than the watermark. Note which channels had data, which were
   empty, and which failed with what error.
4. Cluster semantically similar questions (across channels — the same question in
   Slack, on Stack Overflow, and in a support issue counts once).
5. Classify each cluster vs. the FAQ: already covered; covered but needs
   update/expansion; or not covered (new-entry candidate).
6. Draft proposals (format below).
7. Write the updated `watermark` to `cache-memory`.
8. **Terminal action — end with exactly one safe output:**
   - Anything worth reporting → call `create_issue` with the full report.
   - Every reachable channel genuinely empty → call `noop` with a one-line reason.
   - Never finish without a safe-output call.
## Output: issue format

### Summary
Trends this period; volume up or down; common themes.

### Channel Coverage
One line per channel — every pre-fetched source (adoptium-support, installer,
containers, adoptium.net, org Discussions, Stack Overflow, Reddit, each mailing
list) plus Slack — stating read / empty / failed, and on failure why. For Slack
specifically, state whether `slack_list_channels` / `slack_get_channel_history`
were called and, on failure, the verbatim error returned. "Not invoked" is not an
acceptable Slack status — it means the mandatory read was skipped.

### Proposed New FAQ Entries
Per proposal, in order: why it belongs (1–2 sentences); motivating discussions
(links, or Slack channel + approximate time); a paste-ready AsciiDoc block matching
the existing style:

```asciidoc
== <Proposed question>?

<Draft answer in AsciiDoc, using link:/path[label] and https://url[label]>
```

Then: **Apply to:** `content/asciidoc-pages/docs/faq/index.adoc` in `adoptium/adoptium.net`.

### Existing FAQ Improvements
Entries to expand, clarify, update, merge, or remove — name the `== Heading`, the
change, and the reasoning. Give proposed wording as a paste-ready AsciiDoc block.

### Frequently Asked (already covered)
Recurring questions already handled adequately — useful signal, no change needed.

### Documentation Gaps
Where users consistently struggled to find answers.

### Notable One-Offs
Individual questions that are unlikely to warrant an FAQ entry but are still
worth surfacing — a novel bug report, an unusual environment, a sharp question a
maintainer may want to see. One line each with a source link. These do not drive
FAQ changes; they are reported as signal.

## Constraints

- Do **not** modify the FAQ directly; propose only.
- Every block must be valid AsciiDoc matching the existing style.
- Prefer official maintainer answers over community speculation.
- Base FAQ proposals on recurring or broadly useful questions. Still report
  one-offs under **Notable One-Offs** — they are useful signal even when they do
  not warrant an FAQ change.
- Never duplicate an existing entry; compare against `faq.adoc` first.
- Include source links wherever possible.
- Exactly one issue per run, or a `noop`. Never neither.
