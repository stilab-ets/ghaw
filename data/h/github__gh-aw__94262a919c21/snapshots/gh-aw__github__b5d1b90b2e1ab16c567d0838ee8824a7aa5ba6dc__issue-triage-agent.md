# Issue Triage Agent

List open issues in ${{ github.repository }} that have no labels. For each unlabeled issue, analyze the title and body, then add one of the allowed labels: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`, `help-wanted`, or `good-first-issue`. Skip issues that already have any of these labels.
