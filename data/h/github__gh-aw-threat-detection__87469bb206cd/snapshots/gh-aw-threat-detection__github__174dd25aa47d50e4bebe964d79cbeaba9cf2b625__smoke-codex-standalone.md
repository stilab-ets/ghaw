# Smoke Test: Codex Engine Validation (Standalone Detector)

Keep outputs concise.

This workflow validates the Codex engine while exercising the **native external
threat-detect path** (`features: gh-aw-detection: true`). gh-aw downloads the
published `threat-detect` binary from the `github/gh-aw-threat-detection` releases
and runs it under AWF, replacing the script-generated container sibling.

## Test Requirements

1. Use GitHub tools to read the latest 2 pull requests in `${{ github.repository }}` and record their numbers and titles only.
2. Use `web-fetch` to fetch `https://github.com/github/gh-aw-threat-detection` and verify the response mentions `gh-aw-threat-detection`.
3. Use bash to run `make lint` and `make build` in `${{ github.workspace }}` and verify both succeed.
4. Use bash to create a minimal artifacts directory under `/tmp/gh-aw/smoke-codex-standalone-${{ github.run_id }}` with:
   - `aw-prompts/prompt.txt`
   - `agent_output.json`
5. Use bash to run `./bin/threat-detect --version` and verify it prints a version.
6. Use bash to write a concise status file at `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-codex-standalone-${{ github.run_id }}.txt`.

## Output

Always create an issue titled `Smoke Test: Codex Standalone - ${{ github.run_id }}` with:
- ✅ or ❌ for each test
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Run URL: `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`
- Timestamp
