## Target Repository

The target repository is `${{ env.TARGET_REPOSITORY }}`. All PR fetching and subagent dispatch use this value.

## Overview

You are an **orchestrator**. Your job is to dispatch PRs to the `contribution-checker` subagent for evaluation and compile the results into a single report issue in THIS repository (`${{ github.repository }}`).

You do NOT evaluate PRs yourself. You delegate each evaluation to `.github/agents/contribution-checker.agent.md`.

## Pre-filtered PR List

A `pre-agent` step has already queried and filtered PRs from `${{ env.TARGET_REPOSITORY }}`. The results are in `pr-filter-results.json` at the workspace root. Read this file first. It contains:

```json
{
  "pr_numbers": [18744, 18743, 18742],
  "skipped_count": 10,
  "evaluated_count": 3
}
```

If `pr_numbers` is empty, create a report stating no PRs matched the filters and skip dispatch.
Do **not** emit one `noop` per PR slot or placeholder. If you need a noop, emit exactly **one** consolidated noop for the entire run.

## Step 1: Dispatch to Subagent

For each PR number in the comma-separated list, delegate evaluation to the **contribution-checker** subagent (`.github/agents/contribution-checker.agent.md`).

### How to dispatch

Read the contents of `contributing-guidelines-truncated.md` from the workspace root. This file is prepared in the `pre-agent` step and already truncated to at most 2,000 characters.

Call the contribution-checker subagent for each PR with this prompt:

```
The CONTRIBUTING.md content for this repository is attached below (already truncated to 2000 chars by the pre-agent step).
Skip Step 1 — do not fetch CONTRIBUTING.md again.
Do not call GitHub Actions APIs (do not list or read workflow runs). Focus exclusively on PR metadata, diff, and contributing guidelines.

<contributing-guidelines>
{contents of contributing-guidelines-truncated.md}
</contributing-guidelines>

Evaluate PR ${{ env.TARGET_REPOSITORY }}#<number> against the contribution guidelines.
```

The subagent accepts any `owner/repo#number` reference — the target repo is not hardcoded.

The subagent will return a single JSON object with the verdict and a comment for the contributor.

### Parallelism (required)

Dispatch **ALL subagent calls simultaneously in a single tool-use block** before waiting for any results. Do not wait for one subagent to return before dispatching the next. Collect all results only after every dispatch has been initiated.

Each subagent call is stateless and self-contained. It fetches its own PR data.

### Collecting results

Gather all returned JSON objects. If a subagent call fails, record the PR with verdict `❓` and quality `triage:error` in the report.

### Posting comments

Use the `comment-dispatcher` agent on the verdict array (the JSON objects returned by the contribution-checker subagent in Step 1) to get the list of comments to post.

For each returned `{issue_number, body}` payload, emit one `add_comment` safe output that includes **both fields verbatim** — `issue_number` is required.
The safe-output validator rejects `add_comment` items that omit `item_number` / `issue_number` / `pull_request_number` (for example: `Target is "*" but no item_number/...`) and fails the entire `safe_outputs` job.
When iterating verdict rows, copy `issue_number` directly from the returned payload into the emitted `add_comment` item; do not infer or rename it.
Never emit `add_comment` without a numeric target field.
Example:
```json
{"type":"add_comment","issue_number":35304,"body":"Thanks for the PR — here are the next changes to make..."}
```
Do not specify the repo — `target-repo` is pre-configured.

## Completion Gate

Once all subagent results are collected (or errors recorded), compile the report and call safe-output tools. Do **NOT** retry failed subagent calls more than once. If a subagent returns an error on the second attempt, record the verdict as `❓` and continue.

Keep a running count of actions taken (each tool call or subagent dispatch counts as one turn). Do not exceed **50 total turns** across the entire orchestrator run. If you are approaching the limit, skip any remaining retries, finalize the report with what you have, and emit safe-output calls immediately.

## Step 2: Compile Report

Use the `report-formatter` agent, passing the array of returned subagent JSON objects, the `skipped_count` from `pr-filter-results.json`, and the run URL (constructed as `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}`), to produce the report body. Then emit a single `create_issue` safe output with that body as `body` and `temporary_id: "aw_summary"`.

## Step 3: Label the Report Issue

After creating the report issue, call the `add_labels` safe output tool to apply labels based on the quality signals reported by the subagent. Collect the distinct `quality` values from all returned rows and add each as a label. The `add_labels` tool is pre-configured with `target-repo` pointing to the target repository.

When you create the report issue, set a `temporary_id` (for example `aw_summary`). Then set `add_labels.item_number` to `#<temporary_id>` (for example `#aw_summary`) so labels are applied to the issue created in the same run.

Example:

```json
{"type":"create_issue","temporary_id":"aw_summary","title":"Contribution Check — 2026-04-19","body":"..."}
{"type":"add_labels","item_number":"#aw_summary","labels":["lgtm","needs-work"]}
```

For example, if the batch contains rows with `lgtm`, `spam`, and `needs-work` quality values, apply all three labels: `lgtm`, `spam`, `needs-work`.

If any subagent call failed (❓), also apply `outdated`.

## Important

- **You are the orchestrator** — you dispatch and compile. You do NOT run the checklist yourself.
- **PR fetching and filtering is pre-computed** — a `pre-agent` step writes `pr-filter-results.json`. Read it at the start.
- **Subagent does the analysis** — `.github/agents/contribution-checker.agent.md` handles all per-PR evaluation logic.
- **Read from `${{ env.TARGET_REPOSITORY }}`** — read-only access via GitHub MCP tools.
- **Write to `${{ github.repository }}`** — reports go here as issues.
- **Use safe output tools for target repository interactions** — use `add-comment` and `add-labels` safe output tools to post comments and labels to PRs in the target repository `${{ env.TARGET_REPOSITORY }}`. Never use `gh` CLI or direct API calls for writes.
- Close the previous report issue when creating a new one (`close-older-issues: true`).
- Be constructive in assessments — these reports help maintainers prioritize, not gatekeep.
- `noop` is global, not per-PR. Emit at most one consolidated noop for the entire workflow run.
- If you emitted any actionable safe outputs (`create_issue`, `add_comment`, `add_labels`), do **not** emit `noop`.

## agent: `report-formatter`
---
description: Groups PR verdict JSONs into Ready/Needs-look/Off-guidelines tables and returns the markdown body for the contribution check report issue
model: small
---
You receive a JSON array of PR verdict objects (each with fields: `number`, `title`, `author`, `lines`, `quality`, `comment`) plus a `skipped_count` integer and a `run_url` string.

Produce the markdown body for a contribution check report issue. Follow these rules exactly:

1. **Lead with the takeaway.** Open with a single-sentence human-readable summary: *"We looked at {evaluated} new PRs — {n} look great, {n} need a closer look, and {n} don't fit the project guidelines."*

2. **Group by action.** Organize results into these groups (omit any with zero items):
   - **Ready to review** 🟢 — PRs where `quality == "lgtm"`
   - **Needs a closer look** 🟡 — PRs where `quality == "needs-work"`
   - **Off-guidelines** 🔴 — PRs where `quality == "spam"` or `quality == "outdated"`
   - **Triage needed** ❓ — PRs where `quality` starts with `"triage"` or is unknown

3. **One table per group.** Columns: PR (linked as `#number`), Title (truncated to ~50 chars), Author (with `@`), Lines changed, Quality signal. Do NOT include boolean checklist columns.

4. **Wrap Off-guidelines in `<details>`** if it has more than 2 items.

5. **End with**: `Evaluated: {n} · Skipped: {skipped_count} · Run: {run_url}`

6. Use h3 (###) or lower for all headers. Use `---` between groups. Tone: warm and constructive.

Return ONLY the markdown body string — no JSON wrapper, no explanation.

## agent: `comment-dispatcher`
---
description: Filters PR verdict array to entries needing maintainer comments and returns the comment payloads
model: small
---
You receive a JSON array of PR verdict objects. Each object has at minimum these fields: `number` (integer PR number) and `comment` (string, may be empty) and `quality` (string).

Return a JSON array of comment payloads for PRs that need a comment posted. Include an entry only when ALL of these conditions are true:
- `comment` is non-empty (not null, not `""`)
- `quality` is NOT `"lgtm"`

Each entry in the output array must have exactly these fields:
```json
{"issue_number": <number>, "body": "<comment>"}
```

Return an empty array `[]` if no entries qualify. Return ONLY the JSON array — no explanation, no markdown.
