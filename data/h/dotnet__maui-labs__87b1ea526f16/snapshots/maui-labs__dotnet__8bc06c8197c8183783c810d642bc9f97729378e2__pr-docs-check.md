# PR Documentation Check

Analyze a merged pull request in `dotnet/maui-labs` and determine whether
documentation updates are needed on the `dotnet/docs-maui` documentation site.

## Context

- **Repository**: `${{ github.repository }}`
- **PR Number**: `${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.inputs.pr_number }}`
- **PR Title**: `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}`

## Step 1: Gather PR Information

Use the GitHub tools to read the full pull request details for the PR number above,
including the title, description, author, labels, base branch, and the full diff of changes.

If this was triggered via `workflow_dispatch`, use the `pr_number` input to look up
the PR details. If the PR number is invalid or the PR cannot be found, stop and
comment on the workflow run that the input was invalid. If the PR was not merged
(still open or closed without merging), comment that no documentation updates are
needed because the PR was not merged, then **stop**.

## Step 2: Quick Filter — Skip Obviously Non-Doc PRs

Before doing a deep analysis, check if this PR can be **skipped entirely**:

**Skip if:**
- PR has the `no-docs-needed` label
- PR author is a bot (`dotnet-maestro[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, `github-actions[bot]`)
- PR title contains "backport" (case-insensitive)
- ALL changed files are tests only (paths containing `/tests/`, `/TestUtils/`,
  files with `.Tests.` or `.UnitTests.` in name)
- ALL changed files are CI/build infrastructure only (`eng/`, `.github/`,
  `*.yml`, `*.yaml`, `*.props`, `*.targets`)

If the PR is skipped, comment on the PR with a brief one-line message confirming
no documentation updates are needed and why, then **stop**.

**Always proceed with analysis if:**
- Any file in `src/Cli/Microsoft.Maui.Cli/DevFlow/` was changed (CLI DevFlow commands)
- Any file in `src/Cli/Microsoft.Maui.Cli/Commands/` was changed (CLI commands)
- Any file in `src/DevFlow/**/Mcp/Tools/` was changed (MCP tool changes)
- Any `.csproj` file with `IsPackable=true` was changed (package changes)

## Step 3: Analyze Changes for Documentation Needs

Review the PR diff for user-facing changes that affect documentation.

**PROCEED with a docs PR if the change includes any of:**
- New or changed CLI commands, flags, or options
- New or changed MCP tools (new tools, renamed tools, changed parameters)
- New public APIs in user-facing packages (AgentClient, DevFlow CLI, etc.)
- New features or capabilities (new platform support, new debugging features)
- Breaking changes — removed or renamed APIs, behavioral changes
- Changed system requirements (minimum .NET version, new dependencies)
- New NuGet packages
- Behavioral changes users will notice (e.g., a CLI flag works differently)

**SKIP (no docs PR needed) if the change is only:**
- Internal refactoring with no public API or behavior change
- Test-only changes
- Bug fixes that don't change documented behavior
- Dependency version bumps with no user impact
- Code style or formatting changes
- Performance improvements that don't change usage patterns
- Help text or error message fixes (these are self-documenting)

**When uncertain, PROCEED.** Draft PRs are cheap; missing docs are expensive.

## Step 4: If Documentation IS Needed

### 4a: Check Existing Documentation

Use the GitHub tools to read the current documentation in `dotnet/docs-maui`.
The developer-tools documentation lives under `docs/developer-tools/` with this structure:

**CLI documentation** (`docs/developer-tools/cli/`):
- `index.md` — .NET MAUI CLI overview
- `environment-diagnostics.md` — Environment diagnostics with `maui doctor`
- `android-management.md` — Android SDK and emulator management
- `device-management.md` — Device management

**DevFlow documentation** (`docs/developer-tools/devflow/`):
- `index.md` — DevFlow overview
- `visual-tree-screenshots.md` — Visual tree inspection and screenshots
- `element-interaction.md` — Element interaction and automation
- `blazor-cdp.md` — Blazor WebView debugging with CDP
- `mcp-server.md` — MCP server for AI agents
- `network-profiling.md` — Network monitoring and profiling
- `broker.md` — DevFlow broker architecture
- `setup-windows.md` — DevFlow Windows setup
- `setup-android.md` — DevFlow Android setup
- `setup-apple.md` — DevFlow Apple platforms setup

Also check:
- `docs/developer-tools/index.md` — Landing page for the developer-tools section
- `docs/TOC.yml` — Table of contents (update if adding new pages)

Before making changes, check if there are any open draft PRs on `dotnet/docs-maui`
with the `docs-from-code` label from recent maui-labs merges. If so, note any
potential conflicts in your PR description.

The documentation is written in Microsoft Learn Markdown format:
- Use `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!TIP]` for callout boxes
- Use `ms.date: MM/DD/YYYY` format in frontmatter
- Code blocks use triple backticks with language identifier
- Tables use pipe syntax

### 4b: Open a Draft PR on docs-maui

Make the changes to the appropriate documentation files and open a draft pull
request on `dotnet/docs-maui`. Match changes to the right page:
- CLI command changes → update the relevant `docs/developer-tools/cli/` page
- DevFlow feature changes → update the relevant `docs/developer-tools/devflow/` page
- New capabilities that don't fit existing pages → create a new page and add it to `docs/TOC.yml`

The PR should:
- Update the `ms.date` field in the frontmatter of changed files to today's date
- Include a clear PR title describing the documentation update
- In the PR body, link to the source PR in `dotnet/maui-labs` that triggered the change
- Keep changes minimal — only update what's needed for this specific PR

### 4c: Comment on the Source PR

Comment on the original PR in `dotnet/maui-labs` with:
- A summary of the documentation changes made
- A link to the draft PR on `dotnet/docs-maui`

## Step 5: If Documentation is NOT Needed

Comment on the PR in `dotnet/maui-labs` with a brief one-line message confirming
no documentation updates are required and a short reason (e.g., "internal
refactoring only", "test changes only", "bug fix with no behavioral change").

Keep the comment concise — one or two sentences maximum.
