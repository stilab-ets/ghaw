# Daily Container Image Security Scan

Review the Syft SBOM, Grype vulnerability, and Grant license scan results in
`/tmp/gh-aw/agent/image-scan/compile-output.txt`.

1. Read `compile-output.txt`.
2. For each image with vulnerabilities or license violations, create one issue.
   Use the title `Container findings for <image-name>` so repeated findings for
   the same image are deduplicated. If the scan step failed to produce output,
   create a `Container scan operational failure` issue.
3. If there are no findings and no operational errors, call `noop`.
4. Format each image issue with `###` and `####` headings only. Keep a visible
   `### Summary` section at the top, and wrap verbose per-vulnerability or
   per-license breakdowns in `<details><summary>...</summary>` blocks.
5. In each image issue, include:
   - the image name and pinned reference;
   - every vulnerability with severity, CVE ID, package, installed version, and
     fixed versions;
   - every rejected or unknown license and the affected package;
   - actionable remediation guidance.
6. Keep the report factual and compact. Never omit lower-severity
   vulnerabilities.

The configured `create-issue` safe output is the only allowed write operation.
