# mcpg Read-Only Stress Test — Default AWF Runtime

`RUNTIME_LABEL` = **default AWF (normal container isolation)**.

This run exercises the gateway's read-only guarantee while the agent runs under
the **default AWF sandbox** (no extra-isolation runtime). Follow the shared test
plan below, attempting reads (expect ALLOWED) and writes (expect BLOCKED) on both
the MCP tool-call surface and the proxied CLI surface.
