## Report Assignment

Detect flaky tests by combining open issues likely related to flakiness and recent failed CI runs, then file one evidence-based triage issue when concrete action is needed.

### Data Gathering

1. Discover candidate flakiness labels for this repository (for example labels containing `flaky`, `flakey`, or `intermittent`) and use them when searching issues.
2. Search open issues for likely flaky-test reports using discovered labels plus keyword fallback (`flaky`, `flakey`, `intermittent`), then gather:
   - failing test names
   - workflow/job names
   - links to logs or run IDs
3. Inspect failed workflow runs from the last 7 days:
   - Use `github` Actions APIs (or `gh api`) to list recent failed runs.
   - For candidate runs, list failed jobs and inspect logs in `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/`.
4. Build a frequency map of repeated failing tests across runs/issues.
5. Check for duplicates:
   - existing open flaky-triage issues
   - open PRs that already fix the same repeated failure

### What to Look For

- Failures that recur across multiple runs or branches.
- Same test failing with different surrounding stack traces or timing symptoms.
- Environment-sensitive failures (race, timeout, order dependence, resource contention).
- Existing retry/timeout mitigations that mask a persistent underlying defect.

### Analysis Rules

- Only recommend a fix when you have identified the **true root cause** with clear, supporting evidence — not a hypothesis. A noop is always preferable to a speculative or workaround fix.
- Retries, timeouts, and quarantine are **not fixes**. Do not recommend them as remediation steps. They may be noted as existing mitigations already in place, but never as the recommended action.
- Do not report one-off or non-reproducible failures lacking repeat evidence.
- Do not include items already tracked by a current open issue/PR unless new, material evidence changes prioritization.

### Triage Reports (When Root Cause Is Unclear)

When a **clear repeated failure pattern** exists (3+ occurrences across different runs) but the root cause cannot be definitively identified from available CI logs alone, file a **triage report** instead of a full investigation. A triage report:

- Documents the failure pattern (test name, frequency, error signatures)
- Lists affected runs with links
- Provides candidate hypotheses ranked by likelihood based on available evidence
- Suggests concrete investigation steps a developer could take (e.g., "add timing instrumentation to X", "check if Y resource is shared across parallel jobs")
- Does NOT recommend retries, timeouts, or quarantine as solutions

Use the issue title format: `Flaky pattern: [test name] — triage needed`

### Quality Gate — When to Noop

Call `noop` when:
- no repeated flaky pattern is found (fewer than 3 occurrences), or
- all repeated failures are already actively tracked with sufficient detail, or
- the failure occurred only once and lacks repeat evidence.

### Issue Format

**Issue title:**
- Root cause identified: Brief flaky-test investigation summary for the window
- Root cause unclear but repeated pattern exists: `Flaky pattern: [test name] — triage needed`

**Issue body:**

> ## Flaky Test Investigation Report
>
> **Window:** [date range analyzed]
>
> ### 1. [Test or failure cluster]
> **Evidence:**
> - Run(s): [links]
> - Job(s): [names]
> - Frequency: [count]
> - Representative error: [short snippet]
>
> **Root cause:** [specific, evidence-based — include only when truly identified]
> **Recommended fix:** [concrete root-cause fix steps — include only when root cause is identified]
>
> **If triage report:**
> - Candidate hypotheses: [ranked by likelihood]
> - Suggested investigation steps: [concrete next checks]
>
> ## Suggested Actions
> - [ ] [Concrete fix task or investigation task]
> - [ ] [Validation task to confirm stability]
