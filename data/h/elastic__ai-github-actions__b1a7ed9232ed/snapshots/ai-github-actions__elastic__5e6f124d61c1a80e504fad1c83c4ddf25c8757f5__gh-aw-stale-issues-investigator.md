Find open issues that are very likely already resolved, label them as stale candidates, and file a report.

### Data Gathering

0. **Read the prescanned issue index**

   A prescan step has already fetched open issues (sorted by least recently updated) into `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/open-issues.tsv` with columns: number, title, updated_at, created_at, label_names. Start by reading this file:

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/gh-aw/agent/open-issues.tsv
   ```

   Use this as your initial candidate pool. Issues at the top of the file (oldest `updated_at`) are the most likely stale candidates. Skip issues whose labels include `epic`, `tracking`, `umbrella`, or similar meta-labels.

1. **Build a candidate set (progressive age tiers)**

   Start with the oldest issues and work toward newer ones. Run high-signal queries first, then fill with dormant-issue queries tier by tier until you have at least 10 candidates or exhaust all tiers.


   **Dormant-issue tiers (oldest first):**
   ```
   Tier 1: updated:<{today - 90 days}
   Tier 2: updated:<{today - 60 days}
   Tier 3: updated:<{today - 30 days}
   ```

   Run Tier 1 first. If the total candidate pool (high-signal + dormant) has fewer than 10 issues after de-duplication, run Tier 2. If still under 10, run Tier 3. Stop as soon as you reach 10+ candidates or exhaust all tiers.

   Paginate each query (use `per_page: 50`), collect issue numbers, and de-duplicate across all queries.

2. **Fetch candidate details**

   For each candidate issue, gather:
   - The issue title, body, and labels
   - The full comment thread via `issue_read` with method `get_comments`
   - Any linked PRs mentioned in comments or the issue body

   Track coverage stats: total open issues (from `repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue is:open`), candidate count, and fully analyzed count.

3. **Check for resolving PRs**

   For each candidate issue, look for merged PRs that resolve it:
   - Search for PRs that reference the issue number: `repo:{owner}/{repo} is:pr is:merged {issue_number}`
   - Check if any merged PR body contains `fixes #{number}`, `closes #{number}`, or `resolves #{number}` (these may not have auto-closed the issue due to branch targeting or other reasons)
   - Check the issue timeline for linked PR events

4. **Check the codebase**

   For issues reporting bugs or requesting specific changes:
   - Read the relevant code to determine if the described problem still exists
   - Run tests if applicable to verify the fix
   - Check git log for commits that reference the issue number

If there isn't enough from that, investigate high-signal queries like:
```
github-search_issues: query="repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue is:open in:comments (fixed OR resolved OR closed)"
```

### What Qualifies as "Very Likely Resolved"

Only flag an issue if you have **strong evidence** from at least one of these categories:

1. **Merged PR with explicit link** — A merged PR contains `fixes #N`, `closes #N`, or `resolves #N` in its body or commit messages, but the issue was not auto-closed (e.g., PR targeted a non-default branch)
2. **Code evidence** — The specific bug, missing feature, or requested change described in the issue is verifiably addressed in the current codebase. You must confirm this by reading the relevant code.
3. **Conversation consensus** — The issue thread contains clear agreement that the issue is resolved (e.g., the reporter confirmed the fix, a maintainer said "this is done"), but nobody closed it

### What to Skip

- Issues already labeled `${{ inputs.stale-label }}` — they are already tracked and will be processed by the remediator
- Issues with recent activity (comments in the last 14 days) — someone is still working on them
- Issues labeled `epic`, `tracking`, `umbrella`, or similar meta-labels — these are intentionally kept open
- Issues where the resolution is ambiguous or you aren't sure
- Feature requests where you can't definitively confirm implementation
- Issues with open/unmerged PRs linked — work may still be in progress

**When in doubt, skip the issue.** False positives waste maintainer time and erode trust in the report. Only include issues where you are highly confident they are resolved.

### Labeling

For each issue included in the report, call `add_labels` with the `${{ inputs.stale-label }}` label on that issue. This starts a 30-day grace period — maintainers can remove the label to prevent automatic closure by the remediator.

### Issue Format

**Issue title:** Stale issues report — [count] issues likely resolved

**Issue body:**

> ## Resolved Issues Report
>
> The following open issues appear to already be resolved based on merged PRs, code evidence, or conversation consensus. Each entry includes the evidence supporting closure.
>
> ### 1. #[number] — [issue title]
>
> **Evidence:** [What makes you confident this is resolved]
> **Resolving PR:** #[PR number] (if applicable)
> **Recommendation:** Close as completed
>
> ### 2. #[number] — [issue title]
> ...
>
> ## Suggested Actions
>
> - [ ] Review and close #[number] — [one-line reason]
> - [ ] Review and close #[number] — [one-line reason]

**Guidelines:**
- Do not actually place the issue body in a block quote.
- Cap the report at 10 stale issues per run. If more qualify, prefer oldest issues first — they are highest priority for cleanup.
- Within the same age tier, order by confidence level (most confident first)
- Always include the specific evidence — don't just say "this looks resolved"
- Link to the resolving PR, commit, or code when possible
- If no issues qualify, call `noop` with message "No stale issues found — reviewed {analyzed_count}/{candidate_count} candidates ({total_open} open issues total)"
