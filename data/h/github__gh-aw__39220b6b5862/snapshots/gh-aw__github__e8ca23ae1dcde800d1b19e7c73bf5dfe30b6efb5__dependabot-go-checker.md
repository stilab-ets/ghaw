# Dependabot Dependency Checker

## Objective
Close any existing open dependency update issues with the `[deps]` prefix, then check for available Go module and NPM dependency updates using Dependabot, categorize them by safety level, and create issues using a three-tier strategy: group safe patch updates into a single consolidated issue, create individual issues for potentially problematic updates, and skip major version updates.

**Scope**: Only direct dependencies (packages listed in `go.mod` without the `// indirect` comment) are analyzed. Indirect (transitive) dependencies are out of scope and should be ignored.

## Current Context
- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Go Module File**: `go.mod` in repository root
- **NPM Packages**: Check for `@playwright/mcp` updates in constants.go

{{#if experiments.prompt_style == 'concise' }}
## Your Tasks

**Phase 0 — Close Existing Issues**: Search open `[deps]` issues in `${{ github.repository }}` → close each: `close_issue(issue_number=N, body="Closing this issue as a new dependency check is being performed.")` · `close-issue` safe output (max 20, prefix `[deps]`) · Do not proceed until done.

**Phase 1 — Dependabot Alerts**:
1. Parse `go.mod`; collect lines without `// indirect` → direct deps list.
2. Query Dependabot toolset; discard alerts not in that list.
3. Per alert: record current version, proposed version, update type, security info; web-fetch changelog.

**Phase 1.5 — Playwright NPM**: Read `DefaultPlaywrightVersion` from `pkg/constants/constants.go`; fetch `https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright/mcp` for latest version; determine update type.

**Phase 2 — Categorize** (three-tier):

| Tier | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| A — Safe Patch | Single-version patch only · bug fixes only · no new features · no breaking changes · backward-compatible per changelog | ONE consolidated issue |
| B — Problematic | Minor version · multi-version patch jump · new features · behavior changes · config/code changes needed · safety unclear | Individual issue per dep |
| C — Skip | Major version · explicit breaking changes · significant refactoring needed · insufficient docs | No issue |

**Phase 2.5 — Repository Detection**:

| Package prefix | Repository URL | Release / history URL |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| `github.com/*` | `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}` (strip `/v2`+ suffix) | `.../releases/tag/{version}` |
| `golang.org/x/*` | `https://go.googlesource.com/{pkg}` | `.../+log` (**no** GitHub releases) |
| Other | `pkg.go.dev/{module-path}` → "Repository" link | Source link from pkg.go.dev |

**Phase 3 — Create Issues**:
- **Tier A** → ONE consolidated issue. Title: `Update safe patch dependencies (N updates)`. Body: summary + table (Package / Current / Proposed / Key Changes) + safety assessment + combined `go get` + `go mod tidy` command + test notes.
- **Tier B** → Individual issue per dep. Title: `Update {module} from {old} to {new}`. Body: summary + current/proposed/type + why separate issue + safety assessment + changes + links (repo, release/history, pkg.go.dev) + `go get` command + test notes.
- **Tier C** → No issue.

**Constraints**: Direct deps only · Max 10 issues/run · Do NOT apply updates · When safety unclear → Tier B or C · `golang.org/x` packages: link commit history, not GitHub releases.

{{#elseif experiments.prompt_style == 'step_by_step' }}
## Your Tasks

### Step 0: Close Existing Dependency Issues

1. Search for open issues with title starting with `[deps]` in `${{ github.repository }}`.
2. For each found issue, emit: `close_issue(issue_number=N, body="Closing this issue as a new dependency check is being performed.")`
3. Use the `close-issue` safe output (`required-title-prefix: "[deps]"`, `max: 20`).

✅ **Done when**: All open `[deps]` issues are closed, or none existed.

---

### Step 1: Gather Dependabot Alerts

1. Read `go.mod`; collect all lines **without** `// indirect` → **direct deps list**.
2. Query the Dependabot toolset for dependency update alerts.
3. Discard any alert whose module path is not in the direct deps list.
4. For each remaining alert: record current version, proposed version, update type (patch/minor/major), security info, and fetch changelog via web-fetch.

✅ **Done when**: You have a filtered list of Dependabot alerts with version info for every direct dependency.

---

### Step 2: Check Playwright NPM Package

1. Read `pkg/constants/constants.go` → find `DefaultPlaywrightVersion` constant.
2. Fetch `https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright/mcp` → read `latest` field.
3. Compare current vs. latest: note patch/minor/major update type and any release notes.

✅ **Done when**: You know the current and latest `@playwright/mcp` version and update type.

---

### Step 3: Categorize Each Update

Apply these rules to every alert (including Playwright):

- **Tier A (safe patch)** — ALL of: single-version patch increment; bug fixes only; no new features; no breaking changes; backward compatible per changelog.
- **Tier B (individual issue)** — ANY of: minor version; multi-version patch jump; new features; behavior changes; configuration or code changes required; safety unclear.
- **Tier C (skip)** — ANY of: major version; explicit breaking changes; significant refactoring required; insufficient documentation.

✅ **Done when**: Every dependency has a tier assignment (A, B, or C).

---

### Step 4: Detect Source Repositories

For each Tier A and Tier B dependency:

- `github.com/*` → strip `/v2`+ suffix → `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`; release link: `.../releases/tag/{version}`.
- `golang.org/x/*` → `https://go.googlesource.com/{pkg}`; history: `.../+log`; **do NOT create a GitHub release link**.
- Other → look up `pkg.go.dev/{module-path}` for the "Repository" or "Source" link.

✅ **Done when**: Every Tier A and Tier B dependency has a correct repository URL.

---

### Step 5: Create Issues

**For Tier A** — create ONE consolidated issue:
- **Title**: `Update safe patch dependencies (N updates)`
- **Body**: brief summary · table (Package | Current | Proposed | Key Changes) · safety assessment explaining why all updates are safe · combined `go get` + `go mod tidy` command block · general test notes.

**For Tier B** — create ONE issue per dependency:
- **Title**: `Update {module} from {old} to {new}`
- **Body**: summary · current/proposed version + update type · "Why Separate Issue" explanation · safety assessment · changes from changelog · links (repo, release or commit history, pkg.go.dev) · `go get` command block · specific test notes.

**For Tier C** — no issue.

**Limits**: max 10 issues/run (1 Tier A + up to 9 Tier B).

✅ **Done when**: All Tier A and Tier B issues have been created (or skipped if none qualify).

---

**Global Constraints**:
- Analyze direct dependencies only — skip any `// indirect` entry.
- Do NOT apply updates — only create tracking issues.
- Be conservative: when in doubt about safety, assign Tier B or Tier C.
- `golang.org/x` packages: link to `go.googlesource.com`, never to GitHub release pages.

## Your Tasks

### Phase 0: Close Existing Dependency Issues (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

**Before performing any analysis**, you must close existing open issues with the `[deps]` title prefix to prevent duplicate dependency update issues.

Use the GitHub API tools to:
1. Search for open issues with title starting with `[deps]` in repository ${{ github.repository }}
2. Close each found issue with a comment explaining that a new dependency check is being performed
3. Use the `close_issue` safe output to close these issues with reason "not_planned"

**Important**: The `close-issue` safe output is configured with:
- `required-title-prefix: "[deps]"` - Only issues starting with this prefix will be closed
- `target: "*"` - Can close any issue by number (not just triggering issue)
- `max: 20` - Can close up to 20 issues in one run

To close an existing dependency issue, emit:
```
close_issue(issue_number=123, body="Closing this issue as a new dependency check is being performed.")
```

**Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all existing `[deps]` issues are closed.**

### Phase 1: Check Dependabot Alerts
1. Parse `go.mod` to identify **direct dependencies only** — these are entries that do NOT have the `// indirect` comment at the end of the line. Build a list of their module paths. Discard any Dependabot alerts for modules not in this list.
2. Use the Dependabot toolset to check for available dependency updates for the `go.mod` file
3. Retrieve the list of alerts and update recommendations from Dependabot, keeping only those whose module path matches a direct dependency identified in step 1
4. For each potential update (direct dependencies only), gather:
   - Current version and proposed version
   - Type of update (patch, minor, major)
   - Security vulnerability information (if any)
   - Changelog or release notes (if available via web-fetch)

### Phase 1.5: Check Playwright NPM Package Updates
1. Check the current `@playwright/mcp` version in `pkg/constants/constants.go`:
   - Look for `DefaultPlaywrightVersion` constant
   - Extract the current version number
2. Check for newer versions on NPM:
   - Use web-fetch to query `https://registry.npmjs.org/@playwright/mcp`
   - Compare the latest version with the current version in constants.go
   - Get release information and changelog if available
3. Evaluate the update:
   - Check if it's a patch, minor, or major version update
   - Look for breaking changes in release notes
   - Consider security fixes and improvements

### Phase 2: Categorize Updates (Three-Tier Strategy)
For each dependency update, categorize it into one of three categories:

**Category A: Safe Patches** (group into ONE consolidated issue):
- Patch version updates ONLY (e.g., v1.2.3 → v1.2.4)
- Single-version increments (not multi-version jumps like v1.2.3 → v1.2.5)
- Bug fixes and stability improvements only (no new features)
- No breaking changes or behavior modifications
- Security patches that only fix vulnerabilities without API changes
- Explicitly backward compatible per changelog

**Category B: Potentially Problematic** (create INDIVIDUAL issues):
- Minor version updates (e.g., v1.2.x → v1.3.x)
- Multi-version jumps in patch versions (e.g., v1.2.3 → v1.2.7)
- Updates with new features or API additions
- Updates with behavior changes mentioned in changelog
- Updates that require configuration or code changes
- Security updates that include API changes
- Any update where safety is uncertain

**Category C: Skip** (do NOT create issues):
- Major version updates (e.g., v1.x.x → v2.x.x)
- Updates with breaking changes explicitly mentioned
- Updates requiring significant refactoring
- Updates with insufficient documentation to assess safety

### Phase 2.5: Repository Detection
Before creating issues, determine the actual source repository for each Go module:

**GitHub Packages** (`github.com/*`):
- Remove version suffixes like `/v2`, `/v3`, `/v4` from the module path
- Example: `github.com/spf13/cobra/v2` → repository is `github.com/spf13/cobra`
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}`
- Release URL: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/tag/{version}`

**golang.org/x Packages**:
- These are NOT hosted on GitHub
- Repository: `https://go.googlesource.com/{package-name}`
- Example: `golang.org/x/sys` → `https://go.googlesource.com/sys`
- Commit history: `https://go.googlesource.com/{package-name}/+log`
- Do NOT link to GitHub release pages (they don't exist)

**Other Packages**:
- Use `pkg.go.dev/{module-path}` to find the repository URL
- Look for the "Repository" or "Source" link on the package page
- Use the discovered repository for links

### Phase 3: Create Issues Based on Categorization

**For Category A (Safe Patches)**: Create ONE consolidated issue grouping all safe patch updates together.

**For Category B (Potentially Problematic)**: Create INDIVIDUAL issues for each update.

**For Category C**: Do not create any issues.

#### Consolidated Issue Format (Category A)

**Title**: "Update safe patch dependencies (N updates)"

**Body** should include:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of grouped safe patch updates
- **Updates Table**: Table listing all safe patch updates with columns:
  - Package name
  - Current version
  - Proposed version
  - Key changes
- **Safety Assessment**: Why all these updates are considered safe patches
- **Recommended Action**: Single command block to apply all updates at once
- **Testing Notes**: General testing guidance

#### Individual Issue Format (Category B)

**Title**: Short description of the specific update (e.g., "Update github.com/spf13/cobra from v1.9.1 to v1.10.0")

**Body** should include:
- **Summary**: Brief description of what needs to be updated
- **Current Version**: The version currently in go.mod
- **Proposed Version**: The version to update to
- **Update Type**: Minor/Multi-version patch jump
- **Why Separate Issue**: Clear explanation of why this update needs individual review (e.g., "Minor version update with new features", "Multi-version jump requires careful testing", "Behavior changes mentioned in changelog")
- **Safety Assessment**: Detailed assessment of risks and considerations
- **Changes**: Summary of changes from changelog or release notes
- **Links**: 
  - Link to the Dependabot alert (if applicable)
  - Link to the actual source repository (detected per Repository Detection rules)
  - Link to release notes or changelog (if available)
  - For GitHub packages: link to release page
  - For golang.org/x packages: link to commit history instead
- **Recommended Action**: Command to update (e.g., `go get -u github.com/package@v1.10.0`)
- **Testing Notes**: Specific areas to test after applying the update

## Important Notes
- Do NOT apply updates directly - only create issues describing what should be updated
- **Only analyze direct dependencies**: skip any module listed with `// indirect` in `go.mod`
- Use three-tier categorization: Group Category A (safe patches), individual issues for Category B (potentially problematic), skip Category C (major versions)
- Category A updates should be grouped into ONE consolidated issue with a table format
- Category B updates should each get their own issue with a "Why Separate Issue" explanation
- If no safe updates are found, exit without creating any issues
- Limit to a maximum of 10 issues per run (up to 1 grouped issue for Category A + remaining individual issues for Category B)
- For security-related updates, clearly indicate the vulnerability being fixed
- Be conservative: when in doubt about breaking changes or behavior modifications, categorize as Category B (individual issue) or Category C (skip)
- When categorizing, prioritize safety: only true single-version patch updates with bug fixes belong in Category A

**CRITICAL - Repository Detection**:
- **Never assume all Go packages are on GitHub**
- **golang.org/x packages** are hosted at `go.googlesource.com`, NOT GitHub
- **Always remove version suffixes** (e.g., `/v2`, `/v3`) when constructing repository URLs for GitHub packages
- **Use pkg.go.dev** to find the actual repository for packages not on GitHub or golang.org/x
- **Do NOT create GitHub release links** for packages that don't use GitHub releases
