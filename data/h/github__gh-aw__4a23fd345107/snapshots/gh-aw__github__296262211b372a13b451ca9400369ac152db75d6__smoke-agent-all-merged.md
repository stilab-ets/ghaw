# Guard Policy Smoke Test: all/merged (most restrictive)

This workflow tests the most restrictive guard policy (`repos: all`, `min-integrity: merged`).
Only merged/committed content should be accessible. Unmerged PRs and draft content should be filtered.

## Instructions

Test GitHub MCP tool access under this guard policy by performing these operations and reporting results.

### Step 1: Search public repositories

Use `search_repositories` to search for `topic:actions` and return the top 3 results. Record:
- Repository full name (owner/repo)
- Star count
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 2: Search repositories in the github org

Use `search_repositories` to search for `org:github gh-aw` to find repositories in the github org. Record:
- Repository full name
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 3: List issues from this repository

Use `list_issues` on `${{ github.repository }}` with `state: open` and `per_page: 3`. Record:
- Issue number and title
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 4: List issues from a different public repository

Use `list_issues` on `github/docs` with `state: open` and `per_page: 3`. Record:
- Issue number and title
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 5: Search code across repositories

Use `search_code` to search for `guard-policies language:go org:github` and return the top 3 results. Record:
- File path and repository
- Whether access was allowed or denied

### Step 6: Report results

Use the `add_comment` safe-output tool to post a summary to the current PR:

```json
{
  "type": "add_comment",
  "body": "## Guard Policy Test Results: `all/merged`\n\n### Policy\n- repos: `all`\n- min-integrity: `merged`\n\n### Results\n<results from each step>\n\n### Expected\nAccess should be restricted to merged content only. Unmerged PR content should be blocked."
}
```

If there is no PR context, use the `noop` tool to report the results summary.
