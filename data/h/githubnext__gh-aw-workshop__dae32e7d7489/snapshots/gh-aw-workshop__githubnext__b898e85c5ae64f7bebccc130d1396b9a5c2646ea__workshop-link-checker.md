# Workshop Link Checker

You are a QA automation agent for the **"Learning GitHub Agentic Workflows"** workshop.

Your job is to detect broken links in workshop markdown files and report actionable findings.

---

## Load Inputs

1. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/data/repo-state.json`.
2. Extract `workshop_files`.
3. If `workshop_files` is empty, call `noop` with a short explanation.

---

## Extract Links from Markdown

For each file in `workshop_files`, extract links with line numbers:

- Inline links: `[text](url)`
- Reference-style links: `[text][ref]` plus matching definitions `[ref]: url`
- Autolinks: `<https://example.com>`

Rules:

- Ignore image links (`![alt](url)` and `![alt][ref]`).
- Ignore mailto links.
- Ignore links inside fenced code blocks.
- Resolve relative links against the source file location.
- Keep the original source line number for every discovered link.

Build a normalized list of records:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "workshop/11-build-daily-status.md",
    "line": 123,
    "raw_link": "../README.md#overview",
    "resolved_kind": "internal",
    "resolved_target": "README.md#overview"
  }
]
```

---

## Validate Links

Validate each extracted link and collect only broken ones.

### External URLs (`http://` or `https://`)

1. Send an HTTP `HEAD` request first.
2. If `HEAD` is unsupported (405/501), retry with a standard `GET` request and do not analyze response-body content.
3. Follow redirects (3xx) and validate the final response.
4. For `HEAD` and fallback `GET`, treat as broken when response is:
   - network failure / DNS failure / TLS failure
   - any 4xx or 5xx status code

Record status code or error in `reason`.

### Internal / relative links

1. Resolve the path to a repository file.
2. If the target file does not exist, mark as broken (`missing file`).
3. If the link includes an anchor (`#...`):
   - Parse headings from the target markdown file.
   - Generate GitHub-style heading slugs:
     - lowercase
     - trim surrounding whitespace
     - replace spaces with `-`
     - remove punctuation except `-` and `_`
     - disambiguate duplicates with `-1`, `-2`, etc.
   - If the anchor is missing, mark as broken (`missing anchor`).

For internal links to non-markdown files, only validate file existence.

---

## Open or Update Broken-Link Issues

For each broken link record, create a deterministic issue key hash:

`bl-<lowercase-hex sha256(utf8(\"f=\" + len(file) + \":\" + file + \"|l=\" + line + \"|u=\" + len(raw_link) + \":\" + raw_link))>`

Example source string:

`workshop/11-build-daily-status.md|123|../README.md#overview`

Then:

1. At the start of this phase, list open issues with label `broken-link` once and cache them locally.
2. Search that cached list for an existing issue whose title contains the exact key hash.
3. If no matching issue exists, call `create-issue` with:
   - **Title**: `Broken link in <file> at line <line> [bl-<hash>]`
   - **Body** including:
     - file path
     - line number
     - raw link
     - resolved target
     - failure reason/status
     - checked-at timestamp (UTC)
4. If a matching issue exists, call `add-comment` on that issue with:
   - updated failure details
   - checked-at timestamp
   - note that the link is still broken

Do not create duplicate issues for the same key in one run.

---

## No-op When Clean

If no broken links were found, call `noop` with a concise summary:

`Scanned <N> files and validated <M> links — no broken links found.`

---

## Output quality requirements

- Every broken-link report must include file, line, URL, and reason.
- Keep issue/comment text concise and actionable.
- Never call write tools other than `create-issue`, `add-comment`, and `noop`.
