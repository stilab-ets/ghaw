Detect UX design drift — recent commits that introduce new UI or user-facing patterns that duplicate or conflict with patterns already established elsewhere in the codebase.

### Data Gathering

Use a lookback window of `--since="${{ inputs.lookback-window }}"` for all runs (scheduled and manual).

1. Run `git log --since="${{ inputs.lookback-window }}" --oneline --stat` to get a summary of recent commits. If there are no commits in the lookback window, report no findings and stop.
2. For each commit, read the full diff to understand what user-facing patterns were added or changed.
3. Discover existing user-facing patterns in the codebase dynamically — search for related code in source files, templates, and configuration that handles output, prompts, messages, or other user interactions.
4. Use the **Pick Three, Keep One** pattern for the analysis phase:
   - Spawn 3 `general-purpose` sub-agents, each checking for design drift from a different angle (for example: output/message formatting and CLI naming, confirmation dialogs and status representation, color/icon/symbol and progress indicator usage).
   - Include the git log output, recent diffs, existing pattern inventory, and the full "What to Look For" / "What to Skip" criteria in each sub-agent prompt.
   - Each sub-agent should return its best candidate finding or recommend `noop`.

### What to Look For

Focus on places where a recent commit introduces a user-facing pattern that already exists elsewhere in a different form — where consolidation would benefit the user experience. Examples include:

1. **Output and message formatting** — a new command prints a table differently than existing tables; a new error message uses a different style than the established error format; progress indicators use a different style than elsewhere
2. **Confirmation and prompt dialogs** — a new interactive prompt uses different wording, ordering, or structure from existing prompts (e.g., `[y/N]` vs `[yes/no]`)
3. **CLI flag and option naming** — a new flag uses a different naming convention (`--dry-run` vs `--dryRun` vs `--no-execute`) or a different value format than existing flags for the same concept
4. **Status and state representation** — a new feature displays status (enabled/disabled, active/inactive, true/false) differently from how status is shown elsewhere
5. **Help text and usage strings** — new help text uses a different structure, tone, or level of detail than existing help text
6. **Date, time, and number formatting** — a new output formats timestamps or numeric values differently from the established format
7. **Color, icon, and symbol usage** — a new UI element uses different colors, symbols, or emoji for the same semantic meaning as existing elements
8. **Loading and progress indicators** — a new operation shows progress differently (spinner vs dots vs percentage) from existing operations

### How to Analyze

For each potentially impactful change:
- Read the full diff to understand what user-facing pattern was introduced
- Search the codebase for similar patterns — look for the same type of output, message, prompt, or UI element elsewhere
- Compare the new pattern to the existing ones to determine whether they are meaningfully inconsistent
- Check whether an open issue or PR already tracks the consolidation

### What to Skip

- Internal implementation details with no user-facing output
- Changes where the new pattern is intentionally different (e.g., a separate UI context, a deliberate redesign, a different audience)
- Trivial differences that would not confuse or frustrate a user (e.g., minor whitespace differences)
- Changes that already align with the established pattern
- Changes where an open issue or PR already tracks the consolidation
- Cases where no existing pattern exists to compare against

### Quality Gate — When to Noop

**Noop is the expected outcome most days.** Only file an issue when:
- A **concrete, specific inconsistency** exists — you can name the exact files, functions, or output strings that conflict
- The inconsistency would be **noticeable to a user** — they would encounter both patterns in normal use
- **Consolidation is clearly feasible** — the patterns are close enough that a maintainer could reasonably unify them

Do not file for: subjective style preferences, theoretical future inconsistencies, or cases where the difference is intentional or negligible.

### Issue Format

**Issue title:** Brief summary of the design drift (e.g., "Inconsistent error message format across CLI commands")

**Issue body:**

> Recent commits have introduced UI/UX patterns that diverge from established patterns elsewhere in the codebase. The following inconsistencies reduce design consistency for users.
>
> ## Design Drift Findings
>
> ### 1. [Brief description of the inconsistency]

> **Existing pattern (established elsewhere):**
> ```
> [example of the existing pattern — output, code, or config]
> ```
> **Location of new pattern:** [file path(s)]
