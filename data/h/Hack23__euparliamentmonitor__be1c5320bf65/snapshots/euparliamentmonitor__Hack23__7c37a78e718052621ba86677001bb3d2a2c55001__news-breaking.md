    # compares the new branch's tree against main (not just the pushed
    # commits), so a stale base ref alone is enough to trigger
    # "refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
    # .github/workflows/<other>.lock.yml without workflows permission".
    # The same token also gates the GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch` call
    # which 403s on the App token. Root cause of regression runs
    # #26019545674 (motions) and #26017383773 (propositions), both
    # 2026-05-18. The pat-pr-fallback path (PR #1903 / this PR) stays as
    # belt-and-braces; this wiring eliminates the need for it in the
    # happy path. Falls back to GITHUB_TOKEN for forks/dispatched runs
    # where the org secret isn't available.

# 📰 EU Parliament Breaking News — Unified Workflow

## 🔖 Workflow Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `ARTICLE_TYPE_SLUG` | `breaking` |
| Family | **Unified** (Stages A → B → C → D → E in one workflow) |
| Data window | today (last 12 h); fallback one-week |
| Primary feeds | `get_adopted_texts_feed`, `get_events_feed`, `get_procedures_feed`, `get_meps_feed` with `timeframe: "today"`; fall back to `"one-week"` per endpoint if empty/error. |
| Stage A budget | ≤ 4–5 min (per `article-horizons.ts`) |
| Stage B budget (2 passes) | **22–28 min — HARD CEILING per `article-horizons.ts`** (do **not** exceed the per-slug ceiling on Stage B even if Pass 2 still has shallow sections; force `GATE_RESULT=ANALYSIS_ONLY` instead) |
| Stage C budget (gate + optional Pass 3) | ≤ 4 min |
| Stage D budget | ≤ 2 min (deterministic) |
| Stage E budget (commit + single PR) | ≤ 2 min |
| **Stage C exit tripwire** | **minute 36 elapsed** (long-horizon prospective: 39; long-horizon retrospective: 38; electoral: 42) — the **decision threshold** for forcing `GATE_RESULT=ANALYSIS_ONLY` and (if late) skipping Stage D so the run can still reach the PR call. Per-slug stage ceilings live in `src/config/article-horizons.ts`; the tripwire backstops any per-stage overrun. **Note:** Stage D + E run *after* this tripwire, between the Stage C exit and the PR-call deadline. |
| **Hard PR-call deadline** | **minute ≤ 45 elapsed** (target ≤ 42) — deadline for the single safe-outputs `create_pull_request` call. Note: `engine.mcp.session-timeout` is intentionally NOT set — gh-aw v0.71.3 advertises this field but the bundled gateway image (v0.3.1) rejects it; the agent must finish within the 60-min `timeout-minutes` cap regardless. |
| Hard safety cap | 60-min `timeout-minutes` |
| PR rule | **Exactly one** `[news]` PR at end of run |

## 🎯 Article-Type Specifics

- Long-horizon stage helpers: see [`.github/prompts/10-horizon-stage-helpers.md`](../prompts/10-horizon-stage-helpers.md) for the registry-driven Stage-A/B/C contract.
- Every document/event reference MUST include its publish date. Items without a recent date are not breaking news.
- If no new developments exist today, still ship a PR marked `gateResult=ANALYSIS_ONLY` in `manifest.json.history[]` — the deterministic renderer will then emit a noop placeholder rather than a full article.
- Include `intelligence/coalition-dynamics.md` and `intelligence/mcp-reliability-audit.md` in the analysis set (per `reference-quality-thresholds.json`).

### Stage A — Data Collection (Ref: 01, 07)

Run the canonical gateway block from `08-infrastructure.md` §4. Source
`scripts/mcp-setup.sh`, then `scripts/wb-mcp-probe.sh` and
`scripts/imf-mcp-probe.sh`. Collect EP feed data first; fall back to
direct endpoints on failure. Deep-fetch up to 10 procedures / voting
records / meeting decisions into `${ANALYSIS_DIR}/data/`. Target ≤ 4 min.
