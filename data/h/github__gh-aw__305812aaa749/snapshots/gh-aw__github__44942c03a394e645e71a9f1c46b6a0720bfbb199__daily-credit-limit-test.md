# Daily Credit Limit Test (Intentionally Broken)

> ⚠️ **This workflow is intentionally broken.** It exists solely to verify that
> `max-daily-ai-credits: 1` is enforced by the activation guardrail and that the
> system posts the appropriate limit-exceeded message when the budget is consumed.
> **Do not fix this workflow.**

## What This Tests

1. The activation job checks whether the last 24 hours of runs consumed more than 1 AI credit.
2. If the limit is exceeded the agent job is skipped and a "Daily Workflow AIC Guardrail Exceeded"
   message is posted by the conclusion job.
3. Because any real model invocation exceeds 1 AI credit, this workflow will always trip the
   guardrail after the very first run.

## Task (broken by design)

Call the tool `nonexistent_tool_that_does_not_exist` with the argument `"credit-limit-test"`.

This tool does not exist. The call will always fail. This is intentional.

If the daily credit limit of 1 has already been consumed by a prior run today, this workflow
will never reach this point — the activation guardrail will block it first and post the
limit-exceeded message. That is the expected and correct outcome.

If the agent somehow reaches this point (first run only), call `noop` with the message:
"First run: daily credit limit not yet exhausted. Subsequent runs will be blocked by the guardrail."
