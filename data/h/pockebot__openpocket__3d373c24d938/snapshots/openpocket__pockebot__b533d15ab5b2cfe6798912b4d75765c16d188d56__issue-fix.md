# Fix issue via PR

Triggered when a maintainer comments `/fix`.

Issue context (sanitized): "${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}"

Rules:
1. Run `make ci` before changes and summarize baseline status.
2. Make the smallest correct code changes to resolve the issue.
3. Add or update tests that prove the fix.
4. Run `make ci` after changes and summarize results.
5. Create a draft PR that explains:
   - what changed
   - why it fixes the issue
   - how to test
   - remaining risks or limitations
