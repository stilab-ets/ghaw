# Smoke Test: Copilot BYOK (Direct) Mode — Azure OpenAI (Foundry, Entra / GitHub OIDC)

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Purpose

This smoke test validates that Copilot CLI runs in **direct BYOK mode against Azure OpenAI (Foundry) using Microsoft Entra authentication** — triggered by `AWF_AUTH_TYPE=github-oidc` + `AWF_AUTH_AZURE_TENANT_ID` + `AWF_AUTH_AZURE_CLIENT_ID` + `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` being set on the workflow side. AWF forwards these values to the api-proxy sidecar, which exchanges the GitHub Actions OIDC JWT for an Azure AD access token via workload identity federation and injects it as a bearer token on upstream requests. A placeholder credential is injected into the agent. Inference requests are routed through the api-proxy sidecar to the Foundry endpoint, authenticated with the Entra-issued token held by the sidecar. The sibling `smoke-copilot-byok-aoai-apikey` workflow covers the parallel api-key BYOK path; `smoke-copilot-byok` covers the CAPI (`api.githubcopilot.com`) BYOK path.

## Pre-Computed Test Results

The following tests were already executed in a deterministic pre-agent step. Your job is to verify the results and produce the summary comment.

### 1. GitHub MCP Testing
Verify MCP connectivity by calling `github-list_pull_requests` for ${{ github.repository }} (limit 1, state merged). Confirm the result matches the pre-fetched data below.

### 2. GitHub.com Connectivity
Pre-step result: HTTP ${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_HTTP_CODE }} from github.com.
✅ if HTTP 200 or 301, ❌ otherwise.

### 3. File Write/Read Test
Pre-step wrote and read back: "${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_FILE_CONTENT }}"
File path: ${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_FILE_PATH }}
Verify by running `cat` on the file path using bash to confirm it exists.

### 4. BYOK Inference Test
You are running in direct BYOK mode against Azure OpenAI (Foundry) right now, using `o4-mini-aw` authenticated via Microsoft Entra (GitHub OIDC → Azure AD federated credential). The fact that you can read this prompt and respond means the BYOK inference path (agent → api-proxy sidecar → Entra token exchange → Foundry endpoint) is working. Confirm ✅.

- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Note: "Running in direct BYOK mode (AWF_AUTH_TYPE=github-oidc + AWF_AUTH_AZURE_* + COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL) via api-proxy → Azure OpenAI (Foundry, o4-mini-aw) authenticated via Microsoft Entra"
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author and any assignees

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-copilot-byok-aoai-entra` to the pull request.
