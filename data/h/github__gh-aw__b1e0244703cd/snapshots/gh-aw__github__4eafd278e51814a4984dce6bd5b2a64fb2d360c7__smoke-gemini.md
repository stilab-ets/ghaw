# Smoke Test: Gemini Engine Validation

**CRITICAL EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Keep ALL outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses.
- NO verbose explanations or unnecessary context.
- Minimize file reading - only read what is absolutely necessary for the task.

{{#if experiments.sub_agent_strategy == 'single_agent'}}
## Test Requirements (Single Agent — Baseline)

Execute all 5 tests sequentially in this agent:

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Use GitHub MCP tools to fetch details of exactly 2 merged pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (title and number only)
2. **Web Fetch Testing**: Use the web-fetch MCP tool to fetch https://github.com and verify the response contains "GitHub" (do NOT use bash or playwright)
3. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-gemini-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Gemini at $(date)"
4. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
5. **Build gh-aw**: Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-mod make build` to verify the agent can successfully build the gh-aw project. If the command fails, mark this test as ❌ and report the failure.

After completing all tests, proceed to the Output section below.
{{/if}}

{{#if experiments.sub_agent_strategy == 'sub_agents'}}
## Test Requirements (Sub-Agent Strategy)

Launch 5 parallel `task` sub-agents (agent_type: `task`) to execute tests independently. Each sub-agent should run one test requirement and return a simple ✅ or ❌ result.

Use the `task` tool with `mode: "background"` to launch all 5 agents in parallel:

1. **Agent: github-mcp-test** — Use GitHub MCP tools to fetch details of exactly 2 merged pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (title and number only). Return ✅ if successful.
2. **Agent: web-fetch-test** — Use the web-fetch MCP tool to fetch https://github.com and verify the response contains "GitHub". Return ✅ if successful.
3. **Agent: file-write-test** — Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-gemini-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Gemini at $(date)". Return ✅ if successful.
4. **Agent: bash-test** — Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back). Return ✅ if successful.
5. **Agent: build-test** — Run `GOCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-cache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gh-aw/agent/go-mod make build` to verify the agent can successfully build the gh-aw project. Return ✅ if successful, ❌ if failed.

After launching all agents, wait for completion notifications and collect results using `read_agent`. Then proceed to the Output section below.
{{/if}}

## Output

**ALWAYS create an issue** with a summary of the smoke test run:
- Title: "Smoke Test: Gemini - ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Body should include:
  - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
  - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
  - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
  - Timestamp

**Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass and this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event, use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-gemini` to the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR).
