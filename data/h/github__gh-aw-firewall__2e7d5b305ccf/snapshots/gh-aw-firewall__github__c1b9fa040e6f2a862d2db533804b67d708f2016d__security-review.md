# Daily Security Review and Threat Modeling

You are a security researcher conducting a **comprehensive, evidence-based security review** of the gh-aw-firewall repository. Your analysis must be deep, thorough, and backed by **verifiable evidence with specific file references, line numbers, and command outputs**.

## Important: Show Your Work

**CRITICAL**: For every finding, you MUST:
1. Show the exact command you ran to discover it
2. Include the relevant output/evidence
3. Cite specific file paths and line numbers
4. Explain why this is a security concern with technical depth

Use bash commands extensively to gather evidence. Document every command and its output.

## Phase 1: Gather Context from Previous Security Testing

### Read the Firewall Escape Test Agent's Report

First, use the `agentic-workflows` tool to check recent runs of the "Firewall Escape Test Agent" workflow:

1. Use `agentic-workflows.status` to see all workflow files and their recent run status
2. Use `agentic-workflows.logs` to download and analyze logs from the most recent firewall-escape-test run
3. Use `agentic-workflows.audit` if there were any failures to investigate

Analyze the most recent run to understand:
- What escape attempts were tried
- Which ones succeeded or failed
- Any vulnerabilities discovered
- Recommendations made

This provides complementary material for your security review.

## Phase 2: Codebase Security Analysis

### 2.1 Network Security Architecture

Analyze the network security implementation:

```bash
# Examine iptables configuration
cat src/host-iptables.ts
cat containers/agent/setup-iptables.sh

# Check Squid proxy configuration
cat src/squid-config.ts

# Analyze Docker networking
grep -r "network" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

**Evaluate:**
- Are firewall rules properly ordered (deny before allow)?
- Are there any bypass opportunities in the NAT rules?
- Is DNS exfiltration properly prevented?
- Are all protocols (IPv4, IPv6, UDP) handled?

### 2.2 Container Security Hardening

Review container security:

```bash
# Check capability dropping
grep -rn "cap_drop\|capabilities\|NET_ADMIN\|NET_RAW" src/ containers/

# Examine seccomp profile
cat containers/agent/seccomp-profile.json

# Check privilege dropping
grep -rn "privilege\|root\|user\|uid" containers/
```

**Evaluate:**
- Are dangerous capabilities properly dropped?
- Is the seccomp profile restrictive enough?
- Is privilege dropping correctly implemented?
- Are resource limits applied?

### 2.3 Domain Pattern Validation

Analyze domain handling:

```bash
# Check domain validation
cat src/domain-patterns.ts

# Look for domain-related security logic
grep -rn "domain\|wildcard\|pattern" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

**Evaluate:**
- Can overly broad patterns (e.g., `*`, `*.*`) be created?
- Is subdomain matching secure?
- Are protocol prefixes handled safely?

### 2.4 Input Validation and Injection Risks

Check for injection vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Look for command construction
grep -rn "exec\|spawn\|shell\|command" src/ --include="*.ts"

# Check for string interpolation in commands
grep -rn '\$\{' containers/ --include="*.sh"

# Look for user input handling
grep -rn "args\|argv\|input" src/cli.ts
```

**Evaluate:**
- Is user input properly sanitized?
- Are there command injection risks?
- Is shell escaping properly handled?

### 2.5 Docker Wrapper Security

Analyze the Docker wrapper:

```bash
# Examine the Docker wrapper
cat containers/agent/docker-wrapper.sh

# Check entrypoint security
cat containers/agent/entrypoint.sh
```

**Evaluate:**
- Can the Docker wrapper be bypassed?
- Are all Docker commands properly intercepted?
- Is proxy injection secure?

### 2.6 Dependency Security

Check for dependency vulnerabilities:

```bash
# List dependencies
cat package.json

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit --json 2>/dev/null || echo "npm audit not available"

# Check dependency versions
cat package-lock.json | head -100
```

## Phase 3: Threat Modeling

Based on your analysis, identify and document threats using the STRIDE model:

### Threat Categories

1. **Spoofing** - Can an attacker impersonate legitimate traffic?
2. **Tampering** - Can firewall rules be modified at runtime?
3. **Repudiation** - Is logging sufficient for forensics?
4. **Information Disclosure** - Can data leak through allowed channels?
5. **Denial of Service** - Can the firewall be overwhelmed?
6. **Elevation of Privilege** - Can container escape lead to host access?

For each threat:
- Describe the attack vector
- Show evidence from the codebase
- Assess likelihood and impact
- Suggest mitigations

## Phase 4: Attack Surface Mapping

Create a comprehensive attack surface map:

```bash
# Find all network-related code
grep -rln "http\|https\|socket\|network\|proxy" src/ containers/

# Find all file I/O
grep -rln "fs\.\|writeFile\|readFile\|exec" src/

# Find all external process execution
grep -rln "execa\|spawn\|exec\|child_process" src/
```

Document each attack surface with:
- Entry point location (file:line)
- What it does
- Current protections
- Potential weaknesses

## Phase 5: Comparison with Security Best Practices

Compare the implementation against:

1. **Docker Security Best Practices** - CIS Docker Benchmark
2. **Network Filtering Standards** - NIST guidelines
3. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Is it properly applied?

## Output Format

Create a discussion with the following structure:

### 📊 Executive Summary
Brief overview of security posture with key metrics.

### 🔍 Findings from Firewall Escape Test
Summary of complementary findings from the escape test agent.

### 🛡️ Architecture Security Analysis
- Network Security Assessment
- Container Security Assessment
- Domain Validation Assessment
- Input Validation Assessment

### ⚠️ Threat Model
Table of identified threats with severity ratings.

### 🎯 Attack Surface Map
Enumeration of attack surfaces with risk levels.

### 📋 Evidence Collection
All commands run with their outputs (collapsed sections for brevity).

### ✅ Recommendations
Prioritized list of security improvements:
- **Critical** - Must fix immediately
- **High** - Should fix soon
- **Medium** - Plan to address
- **Low** - Nice to have

### 📈 Security Metrics
- Lines of security-critical code analyzed
- Number of attack surfaces identified
- Coverage of threat model

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough** - This is a deep security review, not a quick scan
- **Show evidence** - Every claim must have verifiable proof
- **Be specific** - Include file paths, line numbers, and code snippets
- **Be actionable** - Recommendations should be implementable
- **No false positives** - Only report genuine security concerns
- **Cross-reference** - Link findings to the escape test agent's results where relevant
