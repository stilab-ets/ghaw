# Example: Failure Category Filtering

This workflow demonstrates the `report-failure-as-issue` category filtering feature with both inclusion and exclusion syntax.

## Context

For scheduled workflows that frequently encounter transient infrastructure failures:
- Docker registry timeouts
- AI server 5xx errors
- Firewall startup failures
- MCP image pull intermittent failures

Traditional `report-failure-as-issue: false` suppresses ALL failure reports, including genuine agent bugs.

## Solution

Use category filtering to only report actionable failures:

### Inclusion Syntax (include only these categories)

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  report-failure-as-issue:
    - agent_failure
    - missing_safe_outputs
    - missing_tool
    - missing_data
```

### Exclusion Syntax (exclude these categories, report all others)

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  report-failure-as-issue:
    - "!inference_access_error"        # Exclude AI server transient errors
    - "!ai_credits_rate_limit_error"   # Exclude AI rate limits
    - "!report_incomplete"             # Exclude infrastructure failures
    - "!mcp_policy_error"              # Exclude MCP policy violations
```

### Mixed Syntax (include these, but not those)

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  report-failure-as-issue:
    - agent_failure                    # Include agent failures
    - missing_safe_outputs             # Include missing outputs
    - "!unknown_model_ai_credits"      # But exclude unknown model AI credits
```

This prevents noise while preserving actionable signals.

## Task

Create an issue summarizing this feature.
