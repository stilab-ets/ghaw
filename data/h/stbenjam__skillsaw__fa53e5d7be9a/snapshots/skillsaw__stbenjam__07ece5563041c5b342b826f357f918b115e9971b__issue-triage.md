# skillsaw issue triage (GitHub Agentic Workflow — requires `gh aw compile`)
#
# Security model (see THREAT_MODEL.md and the gh-aw threat-detection reference):
#   - Trust gate: only fires when a maintainer applies the `triage-for-agent`
#     label (labeled event + names filter + roles gate). Anonymous/attacker
#     issues never auto-trigger the agent.
#   - Powerless agent: `permissions: read-all` — the agent that reads the
#     untrusted issue text cannot write anything.
#   - Privilege separation: the triage comment is posted by the `safe-outputs`
#     job, not the agent. `threat-detection` (auto-enabled by safe-outputs)
#     scans the proposed comment for prompt_injection / secret_leak before it
#     is posted, fail-closed.
#   - Egress is pinned to GitHub (+ the Copilot model API).

# skillsaw Issue Triage

A maintainer has labeled the triggering issue `triage-for-agent`. Triage that
issue using the **skillsaw-issue-triage** skill, and post the triage comment it
produces. Once the comment is posted, remove the `triage-for-agent` label.
