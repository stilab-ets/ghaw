## Student Profiles (33 students)

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/sim/data/profiles.json` to load the student profiles. Each student has:
- `id` — unique identifier (1–33)
- `name` — persona name
- `level` — agentic technical level: `beginner`, `github-basic`, `actions-user`, `advanced`
- `personality` — `curious`, `methodical`, `impatient`, `confused`, `skeptical`
- `background` — `no-coding`, `web-dev`, `backend-dev`, `devops`, `data-science`
- `goal` — `personal-learning`, `work-project`, `team-evaluation`, `teaching-others`
- `runs` — number of prior simulation runs (accumulated across days)
- `successes` — number of prior successful completions

### Technical Level Definitions

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `beginner` | No prior GitHub or coding experience |
| `github-basic` | Can clone/commit/push but never used GitHub Actions or AI tools |
| `actions-user` | Familiar with GitHub Actions YAML; new to agentic/AI workflows |
| `advanced` | Experienced developer or DevOps; has used LLM-based tools before |

---

## Simulation Task

### 1. Load student profiles

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/sim/data/profiles.json`. You will update this file at the end with accumulated run counts.

### 2. Simulate each student through the workshop

For **each of the 33 students**, simulate their experience step-by-step using the following rules:

#### Simulation Rules

**Success probability per step** depends on technical level:

| Step | beginner | github-basic | actions-user | advanced |
|------|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| 0 Welcome | 95% | 98% | 99% | 99% |
| 1 Prerequisites | 70% | 85% | 95% | 98% |
| 2a/2b Setup | 55% | 75% | 90% | 97% |
| 3 Create Repo | 65% | 88% | 97% | 99% |
| 4 Actions Intro | 80% | 90% | 85% | 90% |
| 5 Agentic Intro | 75% | 85% | 80% | 88% |
| 6 Install gh-aw | 50% | 70% | 88% | 95% |
| 7 First Workflow | 45% | 65% | 80% | 92% |
| 8 Run Workflow | 50% | 68% | 82% | 94% |
| 9 Understand Output | 60% | 72% | 83% | 93% |
| 10 Design | 70% | 78% | 85% | 90% |
| 11 Build | 45% | 62% | 78% | 90% |
| 12 Test & Iterate | 50% | 65% | 80% | 92% |
| 13 Schedule | 55% | 70% | 85% | 94% |
| 14 Next Steps | 90% | 92% | 95% | 97% |

**Personality modifiers** (multiply the base probability):
- `curious`: ×1.05 (engages more deeply, higher completion)
- `methodical`: ×1.10 (follows steps carefully, highest completion)
- `impatient`: ×0.85 (skips steps, lower completion)
- `confused`: ×0.80 (needs more guidance, lowest completion)
- `skeptical`: ×0.90 (questions value, may abandon)

**Goal modifiers**:
- `personal-learning`: ×1.00 (neutral)
- `work-project`: ×1.05 (motivated to complete)
- `team-evaluation`: ×0.95 (less patient, evaluating quickly)
- `teaching-others`: ×1.08 (thorough, high completion)

A student **fails at a step** if a random roll exceeds their adjusted probability. When a student fails a step, they stop — they do NOT attempt subsequent steps.

Use deterministic simulation: derive pseudo-random rolls from the student id, step number, and today's date (`${{ env.TODAY }}`). This makes results reproducible for the same day.

**Formula**: `roll = ((student_id * 7 + step_index * 13 + day_of_year * 17) % 100) / 100`
where `day_of_year` is the day number in the current year (1–366).
The prime multipliers (7, 13, 17) are chosen to spread values across the 0–99 range without clustering, ensuring each (student, step, day) triple maps to a distinct bucket.

A step succeeds if `roll < adjusted_probability`.

### 3. Collect pain points per student

For each student who fails at a step, note:
- Which step they failed on
- Likely reason (based on their profile):
  - **beginner + setup steps**: "No prior CLI experience — unfamiliar with terminal commands"
  - **beginner + install gh-aw**: "gh CLI extension install command confusing"
  - **impatient + any step**: "Skipped prerequisite reading, hit unexpected error"
  - **confused + workflow syntax**: "YAML frontmatter syntax unclear without more examples"
  - **github-basic + agentic concepts**: "Distinction between classic Actions and agentic workflows not obvious"
  - **skeptical + early steps**: "Value proposition not convincingly stated"
  - **actions-user + agentic intro**: "Kept mapping to classic Actions patterns, got confused by differences"
  - **advanced + basics**: "Introduction moves too slowly; want to jump to complex examples"
  - Any student failing step 6: "gh aw install command requires gh CLI preinstalled — not clearly stated as prerequisite"
  - Any student failing step 11: "Full workflow source harder to understand without line-by-line annotation"

### 4. Aggregate and analyse results

Compute:
- **Overall success rate** (% of students who complete all 15 steps)
- **Per-step dropout rate** (% of students who fail at each step)
- **Top 5 dropout steps** (highest failure rates)
- **Success rate by technical level**
- **Success rate by personality**
- **Most common pain points** (top 10, ranked by frequency)
- **Improvement opportunities** — specific, actionable suggestions for each top dropout step

### 5. Update student profiles

Update `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/sim/data/profiles.json`:
- Increment `runs` by 1 for every student
- Increment `successes` by 1 for every student who completed all 15 steps
- Write the updated JSON back to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/sim/data/profiles.json`

### 6. Read workshop files (if available)

If `${{ env.WORKSHOP_STEP_COUNT }}` > 0, use the available tools to read up to 3 of the workshop step files to ground your improvement suggestions in the actual content. Focus on the highest-dropout steps.

### 7. Create a concise report issue

Use `create-issue` safe output with:

- `temporary_id`: `aw_workshop_simulation_parent` (safe-outputs requires the `aw_` prefix; this parent issue handle is used by child issues in step 8)
- **Title**: `Workshop Simulation Report — ${{ env.TODAY }} (Run #N)`
- where N is the total accumulated runs across all students divided by 33 (round to nearest integer).

Keep the report short and to the point. Keep critical findings visible; move verbose content into `<details>` sections for progressive disclosure.

**Body**: structure the issue as follows:

```markdown
### Overview
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Students simulated: 33
- Workshop steps available: N/15
- Completion: N/33 (XX%)
- Highest-dropout step: Step N (XX%)

### Critical Findings
1. 2-4 bullets with the most important blockers and who they affect.

### Top Repairs to Prioritize
1. Repair summary 1
2. Repair summary 2
3. Repair summary 3

<details>
<summary>Dropout by step (0-14)</summary>

Table with: step, dropouts, dropout rate, top reason.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Segment breakdowns</summary>

Technical level and personality completion tables.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notable student journeys (3)</summary>

Briefly cover one surprising success, one unexpected dropout, and one content-gap case.

</details>
```

### 8. Create actionable sub-issues for repairs

After creating the report issue, create **3-5 child issues** using `create-issue` where each issue:
- sets `parent: "aw_workshop_simulation_parent"` to link directly to the parent from step 7
- has a concise, imperative title starting with `Repair:` or `Improve:`
- describes one concrete workshop improvement only
- includes:
  - problem statement
  - proposed change
  - acceptance criteria checklist (2-4 items)
  - suggested owner profile (for example: `copilot coding agent` or `workshop maintainer`)

Choose repairs from the highest-dropout steps and keep each child issue independently actionable and assignable.
