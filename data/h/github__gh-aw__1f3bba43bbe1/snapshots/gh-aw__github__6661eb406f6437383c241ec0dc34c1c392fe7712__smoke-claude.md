# Smoke Test: Claude Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/smoke-test-claude-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Claude at $(date)"
3. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
4. **Playwright MCP Testing**: Use playwright to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub"

## Output

Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-claude` to the pull request.
