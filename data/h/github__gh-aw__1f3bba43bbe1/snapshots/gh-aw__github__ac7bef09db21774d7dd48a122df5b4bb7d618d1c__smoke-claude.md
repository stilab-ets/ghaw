# Smoke Test: Claude Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **Safe Inputs GH CLI Testing**: Use the `safeinputs-gh` tool to query 2 pull requests from ${{ github.repository }} (use args: "pr list --repo ${{ github.repository }} --limit 2 --json number,title,author")
3. **Serena MCP Testing**: Use the Serena MCP server tool `activate_project` to initialize the workspace at `${{ github.workspace }}` and verify it succeeds (do NOT use bash to run go commands - use Serena's MCP tools)
4. **Playwright Testing**: Use playwright to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub"
5. **Tavily Web Search Testing**: Use the Tavily MCP server to perform a web search for "GitHub Agentic Workflows" and verify that results are returned with at least one item
6. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-claude-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Claude at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
7. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
8. **Discussion Interaction Testing**: 
   - Use the `github-discussion-query` safe-input tool with params: `limit=1, jq=".[0]"` to get the latest discussion from ${{ github.repository }}
   - Extract the discussion number from the result (e.g., if the result is `{"number": 123, "title": "...", ...}`, extract 123)
   - Use the `add_comment` tool with `discussion_number: <extracted_number>` to add a fun, comic-book style comment stating that the smoke test agent was here

## Output

1. **Create an issue** with a summary of the smoke test run:
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Claude - ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp

2. Add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
   - PR titles only (no descriptions)
   - ✅ or ❌ for each test result
   - Overall status: PASS or FAIL

3. Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **fun comic-book style comment** to the latest discussion (using the `discussion_number` you extracted in step 8) - be playful and use comic-book language like "💥 WHOOSH!"

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-claude` to the pull request.
