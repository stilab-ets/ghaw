### Daily Max AI Credits Test

> 🧪 **This workflow tests the per-run AI credits guardrail.** It verifies that
> `max-ai-credits: 1` is enforced by the AWF firewall and that the agent is
> cut off when the per-run budget is exhausted. The run **concludes success**
> when the credit limit is reached as expected.

#### What This Tests

1. The AWF firewall enforces the `max-ai-credits` per-run budget.
2. Once the agent consumes more than 1 AI credit in a single run, the firewall cuts off the LLM API.
3. The prompt forces multiple turns and multiple large-file reads so the run reliably burns credits.
4. The run is expected to be cut off by the per-run budget before all turns complete.

#### Task

Use **at least four separate assistant turns**. Do not combine all work into one response.

Turn 1 (Job 1): Read a large file: `pkg/parser/schemas/main_workflow_schema.json`.

Turn 2 (Job 2): Read a large file: `.github/workflows/daily-max-ai-credits-test.lock.yml`.

Turn 3 (Job 3): Read a large file: `.github/workflows/daily-credit-limit-test.lock.yml`.

Turn 4: Call `noop` with the message: "Completed max-ai-credits multi-turn guardrail test."

After each job, briefly summarize what was read, then continue to the next turn.

Since the per-run budget is `max-ai-credits: 1`, the AWF firewall should cut off the agent
before all turns complete. That is the expected and correct outcome — the run will conclude success.

If the workflow somehow completes without hitting the per-run limit, call `noop` with the message:
"Per-run credit limit not exceeded — verify that max-ai-credits: 1 is enforced by the AWF firewall."
