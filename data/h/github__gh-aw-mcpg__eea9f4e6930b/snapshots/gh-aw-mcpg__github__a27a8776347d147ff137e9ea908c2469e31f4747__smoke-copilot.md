# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation.

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **Make Build Testing**: Use the `safeinputs-make` tool to build the project (use args: "build") and verify it succeeds
3. **Playwright Testing**: Use the playwright tools to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub" (do NOT try to install playwright - use the provided MCP tools)
4. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-copilot-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Copilot at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
5. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
6. **Serena MCP Testing**:
   - Call the `serena-get_symbols_overview` tool DIRECTLY with `relative_path: "internal/server"` to get an overview of Go source files — do NOT use `mcp-inspect` or any other diagnostic tool to pre-check availability; just call the tool and observe whether it succeeds or returns an error
   - Only report Serena as unavailable if the direct `serena-get_symbols_overview` call itself returns an error
   - Also call the `serena-find_symbol` tool to search for symbols and verify that at least 3 symbols are found in the results

## Output

1. **Create an issue** with a summary of the smoke test run:
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Copilot - ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp

2. **Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
   - PR titles only (no descriptions)
   - ✅ or ❌ for each test result
   - Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass, use the `add_labels` tool to add the label `smoke-copilot` to the pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event).
