# Duplicate Issue Detector

Check whether newly opened issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} in ${{ github.repository }} is a duplicate of, or highly related to, an existing open or previously closed/resolved issue. Do **not** triage or make an action plan — only determine whether a duplicate or highly related issue exists.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Issue**: #${{ github.event.issue.number }} — ${{ github.event.issue.title }}

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Issue

Read the issue title and body carefully. Identify:
- The core problem or request (in one sentence)
- Key terms, error messages, component names, or identifiers you can use as search queries

### Step 2: Search for Duplicates

Run several targeted searches. Search **both open and closed** issues.

Suggested queries (adapt based on the issue content):
```
repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue "{key term from title}"
repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue is:closed "{key term from title}"
repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue "{error message or identifier}"
```

For each candidate result, read the title and (if promising) the body to assess similarity.

### Step 3: Evaluate Candidates

**Related issues detection setting**: ${{ inputs.detect-related-issues }}

Classify each promising candidate using the categories below. If related issues detection is disabled (setting is `"false"`), only use the **Clear duplicate** and **Not related** categories — skip the **Highly related** category entirely.

**Clear duplicate** — the candidate describes **the same underlying problem or request**:
- Reports the same bug or requests the exact same feature
- The affected component, behavior, and scope are the same
- A fix for the candidate would fully resolve this issue too

**Highly related** *(only when related issues detection is enabled)* — the candidate is closely related but **not** the same issue:
- Covers a very similar area, component, or failure mode
- One issue is a subset or superset of the other
- Both issues overlap significantly but each has distinct scope or nuance

**Not related** — skip it if:
- The candidate only shares the same general topic area
- The candidate is closed as "wont fix" or "invalid" with no resolution of the underlying issue
- You are uncertain — when in doubt, err on the side of "not related"; if related issues detection is enabled, prefer "highly related" over "duplicate" for borderline overlapping cases

### Step 4: Post Result

Post **exactly one** `add_comment` call total (or `noop` if nothing is found). Do not call `add_comment` more than once.

**If any duplicates (or highly related issues, when detection is enabled) were found:**

Call `add_comment` with a single comment combining all findings. Include up to **3 duplicate issues** and, when related issues detection is enabled, up to **3 highly related issues**, each ranked from most to least relevant to the current issue. Use this format:

```
**Possible duplicates** (issues that appear to describe the same problem):
- #{number} — {one concise sentence explaining why this issue overlaps with the candidate issue}
  <details><summary>More detail</summary>
  {optional extra context about shared symptoms, component, or scope}
  </details>
- #{number} — {one concise sentence explaining why this issue overlaps with the candidate issue}
  <details><summary>More detail</summary>
  {optional extra context about shared symptoms, component, or scope}
  </details>

**Highly related** (separate issues that significantly overlap or share scope):
- #{number} — {one concise sentence explaining the shared scope and the key difference from this issue}
  <details><summary>More detail</summary>
  {optional extra context about the overlap and distinction}
  </details>
- #{number} — {one concise sentence explaining the shared scope and the key difference from this issue}
  <details><summary>More detail</summary>
  {optional extra context about the overlap and distinction}
  </details>
```

Omit the **Highly related** section entirely when related issues detection is disabled or when no issues qualify for it. Omit a section entirely if no issues qualify for it. Put issue references on the main list line (outside `<summary>`) so GitHub renders issue status badges. Keep `<summary>` text generic (for example, `More detail`) and avoid repeating issue titles there. In justifications, refer to the current report as **"this issue"** (not by number). Use neutral, helpful language — the reporter may not be familiar with the existing issues. Do NOT use `fixes`, `closes`, or `resolves` keywords.

**If no duplicate (or highly related issue, when detection is enabled) is found:**

Call `noop` with message "No duplicate found for issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}".
