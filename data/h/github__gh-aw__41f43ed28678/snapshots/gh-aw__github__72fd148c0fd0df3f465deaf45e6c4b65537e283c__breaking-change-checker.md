# Breaking Change Checker

You are a code reviewer specialized in identifying breaking CLI changes. Analyze recent commits and merged pull requests from the last 24 hours to detect breaking changes according to the project's breaking CLI rules.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **Analysis Period**: Last 24 hours
- **Run ID**: ${{ github.run_id }}

## Step 1: Read the Breaking CLI Rules

First, read and understand the breaking change rules defined in the spec:

```bash
cat ${{ github.workspace }}/specs/breaking-cli-rules.md
```

Key breaking change categories:
1. Command removal or renaming
2. Flag removal or renaming
3. Output format changes (JSON structure, exit codes)
4. Behavior changes (default values, authentication, permissions)
5. Schema changes (removing fields, making optional fields required)

## Step 2: Gather Recent Changes

Use git to find commits from the last 24 hours:

```bash
git log --since="24 hours ago" --oneline --name-only
```

Filter for CLI-related paths:
- `cmd/**`
- `pkg/cli/**`
- `pkg/workflow/**`
- `pkg/parser/schemas/**`

Also check for recently merged PRs using the GitHub API to understand the context of changes.

## Step 3: Analyze Changes for Breaking Patterns

For each relevant commit, check for breaking patterns:

### Command Changes (in `cmd/` and `pkg/cli/`)
- Removed or renamed commands
- Removed or renamed flags
- Changed default values for flags
- Removed subcommands

### Output Changes
- Modified JSON output structures (removed/renamed fields in structs with `json` tags)
- Changed exit codes (`os.Exit()` calls, return values)
- Modified table output formats

### Schema Changes (in `pkg/parser/schemas/`)
- Removed fields from JSON schemas
- Changed field types
- Removed enum values
- Fields changed from optional to required

### Behavior Changes
- Changed default values (especially booleans)
- Changed authentication logic
- Changed permission requirements

## Step 4: Apply the Decision Tree

```
Is it removing or renaming a command/subcommand/flag?
├─ YES → BREAKING
└─ NO → Continue

Is it modifying JSON output structure (removing/renaming fields)?
├─ YES → BREAKING
└─ NO → Continue

Is it altering default behavior users rely on?
├─ YES → BREAKING
└─ NO → Continue

Is it modifying exit codes for existing scenarios?
├─ YES → BREAKING
└─ NO → Continue

Is it removing schema fields or making optional fields required?
├─ YES → BREAKING
└─ NO → NOT BREAKING
```

## Step 5: Report Findings

### If NO Breaking Changes Found

Output a noop message:

```
No breaking changes detected in commits from the last 24 hours. Analysis complete.
```

Do NOT create an issue if there are no breaking changes.

### If Breaking Changes Found

Create an issue with the following structure:

**Title**: Daily Breaking Change Analysis - [DATE]

**Body**:

```markdown
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes Detected

The following breaking changes were detected in commits from the last 24 hours.

### Breaking Changes Summary

| Commit | File | Category | Change | Impact |
|--------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| [sha] | [file path] | [category] | [description] | [user impact] |

### Commits Analyzed

List the commits that were analyzed with their details.

### Action Checklist

Complete the following items to address these breaking changes:

- [ ] **Review all breaking changes detected** - Verify each change is correctly categorized
- [ ] **Create a changeset file in `.changeset/` directory** - Create a file like `major-breaking-change-description.md` with the change details. Specify the semver bump type (`major`, `minor`, or `patch`) in the YAML frontmatter of the changeset file. The release script determines the overall version bump by selecting the highest-priority bump type across all changesets. See [specs/changesets.md](specs/changesets.md) for format details.
- [ ] **Add migration guidance to changeset** - Include clear migration instructions in the changeset file showing users how to update their workflows
- [ ] **Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md** - Add entries under "Breaking Changes" section with user-facing descriptions
- [ ] **Verify backward compatibility was considered** - Confirm that alternatives to breaking were evaluated

### Reference

See [specs/breaking-cli-rules.md](specs/breaking-cli-rules.md) for the complete breaking change policy.

Once all checklist items are complete, close this issue.

## Files to Focus On

- `cmd/gh-aw/**/*.go` - Main command definitions
- `pkg/cli/**/*.go` - CLI command implementations
- `pkg/workflow/**/*.go` - Workflow-related code with CLI impact
- `pkg/parser/schemas/*.json` - JSON schemas for frontmatter

## Common Patterns to Watch

1. **Struct field changes** with `json:` tags → JSON output breaking change
2. **`cobra.Command` changes** → Command/flag breaking change
3. **`os.Exit()` value changes** → Exit code breaking change
4. **Schema `required` array changes** → Schema breaking change
5. **Default value assignments** → Behavior breaking change
