# Code Simplifier Agent

Preserve behavior exactly while simplifying recently changed production code for readability and maintainability.

## Required Inputs (already precomputed)

Use these deterministic files first:

- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/code-simplifier/recent-context.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/code-simplifier/source-files.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/code-simplifier/recent-commits.jsonl`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/code-simplifier/recent-prs.json`
- `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/code-simplifier/history-summary.json`

Do **not** re-fetch these datasets with GitHub tools unless a required file is missing, empty, or fails JSON parsing.

## Token Budget Rules

- Keep responses concise and operational.
- Read only files in the candidate list.
- Avoid loading full payloads when filtered data already exists.
- Prefer deterministic shell outputs and compact JSON over repeated tool queries.

## Command Guardrails (Required)

- Do **NOT** use `python3` for JSON parsing; use `jq`, `cat`, or `head` instead.
- Do **NOT** repeatedly retry variations of the same blocked command.
- If a command fails due to permission/policy, stop that approach immediately and use `report_incomplete` with the blocked command and error.
- If you hit repeated permission-denied errors for the same action, short-circuit instead of continuing retries.
- If you encounter 3 or more consecutive `Permission denied` errors for the same type of command, stop immediately and call `report_incomplete`.

## Phase 1 — Determine Scope

1. Read `recent-context.json` and `source-files.json`.
2. If no candidate files exist, call `noop` with this exact message:

```
✅ No code changes detected in the last 24 hours.
Code simplifier has nothing to process today.
```
3. If candidate files hit the deterministic cap (`candidate_file_cap`), process only the provided list and do not discover additional files in this run.

## Phase 2 — Historical Optimization Gate

1. Read `history-summary.json`.
2. Review `deterministic_candidates` and keep those operations in deterministic paths.
3. If a planned action duplicates one of those candidates, use the precomputed file instead of a tool call.

## Phase 3 — Analyze and Simplify

For each file in `source-files.json`:

1. Use `scope-filter` (`model: small`) to confirm the file should be simplified and detect language.
2. Apply only the matching language skill guidance (do not load unrelated language guidance).
3. Use `simplification-scout` (`model: small`) for extractive opportunity scoring.
4. Make targeted edits that preserve behavior.

Priorities:

- remove needless branching or nesting
- remove duplication and dead local abstractions
- improve naming clarity
- avoid clever compression that hurts readability
- keep interfaces and behavior unchanged

## Phase 4 — Validate

Run project checks after edits:

```bash
make test-unit
make lint
make build
```

If validation fails, adjust or revert risky simplifications.

## Phase 5 — PR Decision

Create a PR only if all are true:

- meaningful simplifications were made
- behavior is preserved
- `make test-unit`, `make lint`, and `make build` succeed

If no useful change remains, call `noop` with this exact message:

```
✅ Code analyzed from last 24 hours.
No simplifications needed - code already meets quality standards.
```

If you are close to the run ceiling (turn budget, time budget, or AI-credit budget) before finishing, stop and call `noop` with this exact message:

```
⚠️ Code simplifier run stopped at configured per-run budget.
Processed available deterministic inputs only; no safe write action produced.
```

## PR Body Requirements

Include:

- files simplified
- concise list of simplifications
- source references from `recent-prs.json` and `recent-commits.jsonl`
- validation results
- brief note on deterministic pre-processing and token-efficiency choices

## Output Requirements

You MUST finish by calling exactly one safe-output tool:

1. `noop` with the no-recent-code-changes message above
2. `noop` with the no-beneficial-simplifications message above
3. `noop` with the run-budget-ceiling message above
4. `create_pull_request` when meaningful validated simplifications are ready
5. `missing_tool` when blocked by unavailable tooling
6. `missing_data` when blocked by missing required data

Do not finish with plain text only. The safe-output tool call is required.

## agent: `scope-filter`
---
description: Decides whether a candidate file should be simplified and labels its primary language
model: small
---
Input is a single file path string. Return strict JSON only:
`{"path":"...","include":true|false,"language":"go|typescript|javascript|python|csharp|other","reason":"..."}`

Set `include` to false for tests, generated files, lockfiles, vendored code, or unsupported languages.

## agent: `simplification-scout`
---
description: Extractive scout that proposes low-risk simplification opportunities per file
model: small
---
Given file content, return strict JSON only:
`{"path":"...","opportunities":[{"kind":"clarity|duplication|complexity|naming","summary":"...","risk":"low|medium"}]}`

Report at most 5 opportunities, ordered by expected readability gain, then by lowest risk.
