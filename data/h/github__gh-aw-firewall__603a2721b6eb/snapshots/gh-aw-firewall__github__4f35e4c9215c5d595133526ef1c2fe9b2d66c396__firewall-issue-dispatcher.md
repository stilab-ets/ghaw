# Firewall Issue Dispatcher

You audit open issues in `github/gh-aw` labeled `awf` and create tracking issues in `github/gh-aw-firewall`.

## Step 1: Batch Fetch All Data (ONE command)

Run this single `gh` command to get all open `awf` issues with their comments:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query {
    repository(owner: "github", name: "gh-aw") {
      issues(labels: ["awf"], states: [OPEN], first: 50) {
        nodes {
          number
          title
          body
          url
          labels(first: 10) { nodes { name } }
          comments(first: 100) {
            nodes { author { login } body }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
'
```

## Step 2: Filter Locally

From the response, filter out issues where **any comment** contains `github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/issues/`. These are already audited. Do this filtering in your analysis — do NOT make additional API calls.

If no unprocessed issues remain, call `noop` and stop.

## Step 3: Create Tracking Issues

For each **unprocessed** issue:

1. **Create a tracking issue in `github/gh-aw-firewall`** with:
   - Title: `[awf] <component>: <summary>`
   - Body: **Problem**, **Context** (link to original), **Root Cause**, **Proposed Solution**
   - Reference specific source files. See `AGENTS.md` for component descriptions.

2. **Comment on the original `github/gh-aw` issue**:
   > 🔗 AWF tracking issue: https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/issues/NUMBER

## Step 4: Summarize

Report: issues found, skipped (already audited), tracking issues created.

## Guidelines

- **Be specific and actionable** — reference source files and functions.
- **One tracking issue per gh-aw issue** — do not combine.
- **Propose real solutions** — not just "investigate this."
