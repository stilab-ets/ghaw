# Safe-Outputs Issues Enforcement Smoke Test

**IMPORTANT: Keep outputs concise. This test validates safe-outputs enforcement for issue operations.**

## Configuration Under Test

| Safe-Output | Configuration |
|---|---|
| `create-issue` | `title-prefix: "[smoke-safeoutputs] "`, `labels: [smoke-test, automated]`, `max: 3`, `expires: 2h`, `close-older-issues: true` |
| `close-issue` | `required-labels: [smoke-test]`, `required-title-prefix: "[smoke-safeoutputs]"`, `max: 1` |
| `update-issue` | `body:` (enabled), `max: 1` |
| `link-sub-issue` | `parent-title-prefix: "[smoke-safeoutputs]"`, `sub-title-prefix: "[smoke-safeoutputs]"`, `max: 1` |
| `assign-milestone` | `allowed: [v1.0]`, `max: 1` |

**Note**: `create-issue` has `max: 3` to allow creating test issues plus the summary results issue (which also uses `create-issue`).

## Test Matrix

Work through each test case. For each test, attempt the operation and record whether it was **processed** or **rejected**.

### Phase 1: create-issue Enforcement

**Test 1.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: create valid issue):
- Attempt: Create an issue with title "[smoke-safeoutputs] Parent Issue ${{ github.run_id }}", body "Test parent issue for smoke-safeoutputs enforcement test", temporary_id "aw_parent1"
- Expected: ✅ Processed (matches prefix constraint, gets required labels automatically)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.2 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: create valid sub-issue):
- Attempt: Create an issue with title "[smoke-safeoutputs] Sub Issue ${{ github.run_id }}", body "Test sub-issue for smoke-safeoutputs enforcement test", temporary_id "aw_sub1"
- Expected: ✅ Processed (matches prefix constraint, gets required labels automatically)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: create issue without required title prefix):
- Attempt: Create an issue with title "No prefix issue — should be rejected ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (title does not start with "[smoke-safeoutputs] " prefix)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 1.4 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Note: max is 3 and 2 issues + 1 summary issue = 3. Attempt one more creation beyond that limit.
- Attempt: Create one additional issue titled "[smoke-safeoutputs] Overflow Issue ${{ github.run_id }}" after the results issue creation
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 3 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome (test this last, after creating the results issue)

### Phase 2: update-issue Enforcement

Use the parent issue from Test 1.1 for the following tests.

**Test 2.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: update body):
- Attempt: Update the body of the parent issue to append "Updated by smoke test ${{ github.run_id }}"
- Expected: ✅ Processed (body: is enabled in update-issue config)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 2.2 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Attempt: A second update-issue operation (max: 1 already consumed by Test 2.1)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 1 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

### Phase 3: link-sub-issue Enforcement

**Test 3.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: link matching issues):
- Attempt: Link sub-issue (aw_sub1) as a sub-issue of parent (aw_parent1)
- Expected: ✅ Processed (both parent and sub-issue match prefix "[smoke-safeoutputs]")
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 3.2 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: link with non-matching prefix):
- Attempt: Find any open issue that does NOT have the "[smoke-safeoutputs]" prefix and try to link it
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (parent-title-prefix or sub-title-prefix not matched)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no suitable target" if no suitable issue found)

**Test 3.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Attempt: Link a second pair of issues (max: 1 already consumed by Test 3.1)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 1 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

### Phase 4: close-issue Enforcement

**Test 4.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: close matching issue):
- Attempt: Close the sub-issue from Test 1.2 (it has "smoke-test" label and title starts with "[smoke-safeoutputs]")
- Expected: ✅ Processed (matches required-labels and required-title-prefix)
- Record the actual outcome

**Test 4.2 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: close issue without required label):
- Attempt: Close any open issue that does NOT have the "smoke-test" label
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (required-labels: [smoke-test] not satisfied)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no suitable target" if none found)

**Test 4.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: close issue without required title prefix):
- Attempt: Close any open issue that does NOT have "[smoke-safeoutputs]" prefix
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (required-title-prefix: "[smoke-safeoutputs]" not satisfied)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no suitable target" if none found)

**Test 4.4 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Attempt: Close a second issue (max: 1 already consumed by Test 4.1)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 1 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome

### Phase 5: assign-milestone Enforcement

**Test 5.1 — SHOULD SUCCEED** (positive case: assign allowed milestone):
- Attempt: Assign milestone "v1.0" to the parent issue from Test 1.1 (if "v1.0" milestone exists in the repository)
- Expected: ✅ Processed (milestone "v1.0" is in allowed list)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - milestone not found" if v1.0 milestone doesn't exist)

**Test 5.2 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: assign non-allowed milestone):
- Attempt: Assign a milestone that is NOT "v1.0" (e.g., "v2.0" or any other milestone if one exists)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (only "v1.0" is in allowed list)
- Record the actual outcome (mark "SKIPPED - no alternative milestone" if no other milestone exists)

**Test 5.3 — SHOULD FAIL** (negative case: max exceeded):
- Attempt: A second assign-milestone operation (max: 1 already consumed by Test 5.1)
- Expected: ❌ Rejected (max: 1 exceeded)
- Record the actual outcome
