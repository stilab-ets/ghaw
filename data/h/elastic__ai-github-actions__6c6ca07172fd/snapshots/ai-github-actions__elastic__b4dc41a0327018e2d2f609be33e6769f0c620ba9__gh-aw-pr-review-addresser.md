# Address PR Feedback

Automatically address review feedback on pull requests in ${{ github.repository }} — fix code issues, resolve review threads, and push changes.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **PR**: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} — ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
- **Review ID**: ${{ github.event.review.id }}

## Constraints

- **CAN**: Read files, search code, modify files locally, run tests and commands, reply to review comments, push to the PR branch (same-repo only), resolve review threads
- **CANNOT**: Push to fork PR branches, merge PRs, delete branches, modify `.github/workflows/` files

## Instructions

Address the review feedback surgically — make only the minimum changes needed.

### Step 1: Gather Context

PR context is pre-fetched to `/tmp/pr-context/`. Read `/tmp/pr-context/README.md` for a manifest of all available files.

1. Read `/tmp/pr-context/pr.json` for PR details (author, description, branches). Check whether this is a fork PR — if the head repo differs from the base repo, you cannot push changes.
2. Read `/tmp/pr-context/issue-*.json` if any exist to understand linked issue motivation and requirements.
3. Read `/tmp/pr-context/unresolved_threads.json` to get unresolved review threads that need attention. For full context including resolved threads, see `review_comments.json`.
4. Read `/tmp/pr-context/diffs/` to understand the current state of changes.

### Step 2: Address Each Review Thread

For each unresolved review thread:

1. **Read and understand** the reviewer's feedback carefully.
2. **Decide**: Is the feedback actionable? Use your judgment — don't blindly accept every suggestion.
   - **If actionable**: Make the code change. Be surgical — change only what's needed to address the specific feedback. If the fix isn't obvious from the code change alone, call `reply_to_pull_request_review_comment` with the comment's numeric ID to briefly explain what you changed.
   - **If you disagree or it's unclear**: Call `reply_to_pull_request_review_comment` with the comment's numeric ID to explain your reasoning inline. Do NOT resolve the thread — let the reviewer decide.
3. **Track** which threads you addressed with code changes vs. which you replied to.

### Step 3: Validate and Push

1. Run required repo commands (lint/build/test) from README, CONTRIBUTING, DEVELOPING, Makefile, or CI config relevant to the changes and include results. If required commands cannot be run, explain why and do not push changes.
2. Use `push_to_pull_request_branch` to push your changes.
3. **Fork PRs**: If this is a fork PR, you cannot push. Reply explaining that you do not have permission to push to fork branches and suggest that the PR author apply the changes themselves. This is a GitHub security limitation.

### Step 4: Resolve Addressed Threads

Skip this step for fork PRs where you could not push.

After pushing, resolve every review thread that your changes address by calling `resolve_pull_request_review_thread` with the thread's GraphQL node ID (the `id` field, e.g., `PRRT_kwDO...`). This includes threads from any reviewer — external reviewers, bots, and your own prior reviews. Check `/tmp/pr-context/unresolved_threads.json` for all unresolved threads — also check `/tmp/pr-context/outdated_threads.json` for threads where the underlying code changed since the comment was made and verify whether your changes address them. Do NOT resolve threads you disagreed with, skipped, or only partially addressed — leave those open for the reviewer. Fall back to `pull_request_read` with method `get_review_comments` if the pre-fetched data is unavailable.

### Step 5: Respond

Call `add_comment` on the PR with a brief summary of:
- Which review threads were addressed with code changes
- Which threads you replied to instead of fixing
- Tests run and their results

Do NOT duplicate thread-specific explanations in the summary comment — those belong in the inline replies you already posted via `reply_to_pull_request_review_comment`.

**Additional tools:**
- `push_to_pull_request_branch` — push committed changes to the PR branch (same-repo PRs only)
- `resolve_pull_request_review_thread` — resolve a review thread after addressing the feedback (pass the thread's node ID)
- `reply_to_pull_request_review_comment` — reply inline to a specific review comment thread to explain your reasoning
