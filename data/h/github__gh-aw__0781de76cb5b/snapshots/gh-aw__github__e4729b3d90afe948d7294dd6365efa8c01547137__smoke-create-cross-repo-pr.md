# Smoke Test: Cross-Repo Pull Request Creation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible.**

The workspace is checked out from `githubnext/gh-aw-side-repo` (a private side repository used for smoke testing).

## Test Requirements

### 1. Create a Smoke Test File on a new branch

Create the file `smoke-tests/smoke-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with the following content (create the directory if it doesn't exist using bash: `mkdir -p smoke-tests`):

```
Smoke test run: ${{ github.run_id }}
Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
Timestamp: <current UTC timestamp from bash: date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ">
Status: cross-repo PR creation smoke test

1.  Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide
```

## Output

1. **Create an issue** in `${{ github.repository }}` with:
   - Use a temporary ID (e.g. `aw_smoke1`) for the issue so you can reference it later
   - Title: "Smoke Test: Copilot - Cross-repo create PR ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - Body should include:
     - Test results (✅ or ❌ for each test)
     - Overall status: PASS or FAIL
     - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
     - Timestamp
     - Pull request author and assignees

2. **Only if this workflow was triggered by a pull_request event**: Use the `add_comment` tool to add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the triggering pull request (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
   - PR titles only (no descriptions)
   - Overall status: IN PROGRESS

3. Use the `create_pull_request` safe-output tool to create a PR in `githubnext/gh-aw-side-repo` with the added file plus:
- **Title**: "Smoke test: cross-repo PR creation (${{ github.run_id }})"
- **Body**: "Automated smoke test PR created by `${{ github.repository }}` run [${{ github.run_id }}](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}). This PR may be safely closed."

4. **Add a comment to the issue** from step 1 `githubnext/gh-aw-side-repo` reporting whether the PR update succeeded or failed, and if it succeeded, include the line that was added to the PR.

5. **Only if the PR update succeeded**: Add a comment to the triggering pull request in `${{ github.repository }}` (omit the `item_number` parameter to auto-target the triggering PR) with:
   - "Smoke Test: Copilot - Cross-repo create PR ${{ github.run_id }}"
   - The line that was added to the cross-repo PR
   - Overall status: SUCCESS
   - Run URL: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
