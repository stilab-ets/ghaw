Detect documentation drift — code changes that require corresponding documentation updates.

### Data Gathering

Use a lookback window of `--since="${{ inputs.lookback-window }}"` for all runs (scheduled and manual).

1. Run `git log --since="${{ inputs.lookback-window }}" --oneline --stat` to get a summary of recent commits. If there are no commits in the lookback window, report no findings and stop.
2. Discover documentation files dynamically — scan the repository for common doc locations: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPING.md`, `docs/`, `documentation/`, and any `.md` files in the repository root. Do not assume a fixed directory structure.

### What to Look For

For each commit (or group of related commits), determine whether the changes could require documentation updates. Focus on:

1. **Public API changes** — new, renamed, or removed functions, endpoints, CLI flags, configuration options, or workflow inputs/outputs
2. **Behavioral changes** — altered defaults, changed error messages, modified control flow that affects user-facing behavior
3. **New features or workflows** — anything a user or contributor would need to know about
4. **Dependency or tooling changes** — version bumps, new dependencies, changed build/test commands
5. **Structural changes** — moved, renamed, or deleted files that are referenced in documentation
6. **Configuration changes** — new environment variables, changed file formats, altered directory structures

### How to Analyze

For each potentially impactful change:
- Read the full diff to understand what changed
- Read the current documentation files to understand what's documented
- Check whether the relevant documentation was already updated in the same commit or a subsequent commit within the lookback window
- Check whether an open issue or PR already tracks the documentation update

### What to Skip

- Purely internal refactors with no user-facing impact
- Changes where documentation was already updated in the same or a later commit
- Changes where an open issue or PR already tracks the documentation update
- Test-only changes
- Minor changes where the existing docs are still substantially correct (e.g., a new optional parameter with a sensible default)
- Changes that only affect internal implementation details not referenced in any documentation

### Quality Gate — When to Noop

**Noop is the expected outcome most days.** Only file an issue when:
- The documentation is **concretely wrong** — a user following the docs would get incorrect results or errors
- A **new public feature** has zero documentation
- A **removed or renamed** public interface is still referenced in docs

Do not file for: vague "could be improved" suggestions, minor wording drift, or documentation that is slightly imprecise but still functionally correct.

### Issue Format

**Issue title:** Brief summary of what's out of date (e.g., "Update README for new docs-drift workflow")

**Issue body:**

> Recent code changes in the repository have introduced documentation drift. The following changes need corresponding documentation updates.
>
> ## Changes Requiring Documentation Updates
>
> ### 1. [Brief description of the change]
>
> **Commit(s):** [SHA(s) with links]
> **What changed:** [Concise description of the code change]
> **Documentation impact:** [Which doc file(s) need updating and what specifically needs to change]
>
> ### 2. [Next change...]
>
> ## Suggested Actions
>
> - [ ] [Specific, actionable checkbox for each documentation update needed]
