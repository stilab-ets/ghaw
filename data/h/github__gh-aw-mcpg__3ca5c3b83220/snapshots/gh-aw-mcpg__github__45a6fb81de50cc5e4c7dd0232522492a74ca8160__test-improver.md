# Test Improver 🧹

Improve one Go test file per run: better assertions, more coverage, cleaner structure.

## Context

This project uses testify (`github.com/stretchr/testify`). Prefer `require` for fatal checks and `assert` for non-fatal. Use bound asserters (`assert := assert.New(t)`) for files with many assertions.

## Step 1: Select a Test File

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/data/test-files.json` for the pre-computed inventory. Also check `/tmp/gh-aw/data/existing-prs.json` — if an open `[test-improver]` PR exists, call `noop` and stop.

Use `cache-memory` to check which files were previously improved. Select a file that:
- Has manual error checking instead of testify assertions
- Has low coverage of the corresponding implementation
- Has repetitive code that could be table-driven
- Was NOT recently modified (check `git log --oneline -3 <file>`)

Avoid integration tests in `test/integration/`.

## Step 2: Analyze

1. Read the test file and its corresponding implementation file
2. Run coverage on the specific package only:
   ```bash
   go test -coverprofile=/tmp/coverage.out ./internal/<package>/
   go tool cover -func=/tmp/coverage.out
   ```
3. Identify: uncovered branches, missing edge cases, poor assertion patterns

## Step 3: Improve

Focus on:
- **Testify usage**: Replace manual `if err != nil { t.Fatal(...) }` with `require.NoError(t, err)`, use `assert.Equal`, `assert.Contains`, etc.
- **Coverage**: Add tests for uncovered error paths and edge cases
- **Structure**: Convert repetitive tests to table-driven with `t.Run()`
- **Stability**: Use `t.Cleanup()`, avoid timing dependencies, mock externals

Preserve all existing passing tests. Follow project conventions in `internal/testutil/`.

## Step 4: Verify

```bash
go test -v ./internal/<package>/
go test -count=3 ./internal/<package>/
go vet ./internal/<package>/
gofmt -l <test_file>
```

## Step 5: Output

**If improvements were made**: Create a PR via `create-pull-request` with title `Improve tests for <PackageName>`. Include in the body: file analyzed, improvements made, coverage before/after, and test output.

**If no improvements needed**: Call `noop`.

Save the improved file path to `cache-memory` for future runs.
