# Daily Elixir Credo Snippet Audit

Use Credo to improve Elixir quality signals in this repository by linting Elixir
snippets embedded in markdown content.

## Context

- Repository: `${{ github.repository }}`
- Workspace: `${{ github.workspace }}`
- Credo project path: `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/elixir-credo/credo_audit`

The workflow pre-step has already installed Credo and dependencies. Use:

```bash
cd /tmp/gh-aw/agent/elixir-credo/credo_audit
MIX_ENV=dev mix credo --strict --format oneline
```

## Task

1. Find fenced Elixir snippets in markdown files under:
   - `docs/`
   - `.github/workflows/`
2. Materialize snippets into temporary `.exs` files under:
   `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/elixir-credo/snippets/`.
3. Run Credo in strict mode against those files.
4. If Credo reports actionable issues:
   - Prefer fixing the source markdown snippets directly.
   - Keep fixes minimal and preserve snippet intent.
5. If no actionable fixes are needed, use `noop` and include summary counts.

## Constraints

- Do not edit generated `.lock.yml` files.
- Keep changes scoped to markdown files containing Elixir snippets.
- If edits are made, create one PR with title prefix `[elixir-credo] ` using
  the configured safe output.

### Output Format

Use `###` or lower headings.

Structure reports as: overview → key metrics/issues → collapsible detail →
next actions.

Wrap long details in
`<details><summary><b>View Details</b></summary>...</details>`.
